+ Fixed a bug where LOAD_ROBOT or LOAD_BC would not reset the stack
  pointer for newly loaded programs. This could cause crashes if a robot
  popped the stack in the new program.
+ Fixed a bug where range checking of BOARD_X and BOARD_Y would sometimes
  not be done correctly, leading to crashes.
+ Strings in the debug menu list no longer interpret any color codes they
  may contain.
+ Fixed a bug where a string would not be interpreted correctly if it
  used a '.' character in a splice parameter expression. Expressions such
  as IF "$str#('$str2.length'-4)" = "blah" THEN "label" will now work
  correctly.
+ Fixed negative sprN_cheight et al from crashing. (Exophase)
+ Placement of objects on the player will be blocked with an error dialog
  like DOS versions, instead of silently failing after setup. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed a bug where LOAD_ROBOT would not properly parse lines of imported
  code that had leading whitespace. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed an integer wrapping bug in debytecode, disallowed numeric literals
  outside of the bounds of a signed short. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed a bug that would corrupt the UI palette if "set color" was run
  against a color index over 15. (MZXGiant)
+ If either board dimension is less than the editor viewport, the character
  and colors used to indicate space outside of the board are taken from
  protected sets. In game, they are taken from the game's sets.
+ Increase limit on difference for RANDOM "A" TO "B" to UINT_MAX rather
  than INT_MAX - 1 as it was previously. Since the entire range represented
  by a counter is now usable, there are no cases where RANDOM will "break".
+ Fix avalanche rings and potions to limit boulder placement to 1/18,
  matching the AVALANCHE command.
+ Fix corruption and possible crashes when using VIEWPORT SIZE to set the
  viewport to a size less than 80x25 but greater than the current board
  dimensions. The viewport will now always be clamped to board size.
+ Imported libmodplug 0.8.8.1 and rebased all patches.
+ Added experimental port to Pandora. See arch/pandora/README for more
  information. (Exophase)
+ Fix incorrectly changing horizontal mouse position on setting MOUSEY.
  (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed overflow into protected character set when "Revert to..." is
  selected in the character editing dialog. (MZXGiant)
+ Music and SFX now mute when the updater launches and are restored when
  it is complete. (MZXGiant)
+ Fix odd string behaviour when copying between strings that happen to
  be stored close to each other in memory. This fixes a regression
  introduced by the "crash when pasting to and from the same string"
  fix in 2.82b.
+ The size/offset parameters for strings can now be specified in either
  order (#+ vs +#) and will behave correctly.
+ Introduced SOCKS4/4a/5 support transparently into the network layer.
  (MZXGiant)
+ Revert bogus cycle-ending behaviour for SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE,
  SHOOTSEEKER and SPITFIRE.
+ Improve cycle-ending compatibility with MZX versions prior to 2.80.
  Fixes games such as Kya's Sword and Stones & Roks II.

DEVELOPERS

+ Source tarballs are now generated in XZ (LZMA2) format.
+ Make hlp2txt utility work correctly on Windows platforms.
+ Updated and repaired MSVC project for Visual Studio 2010. (MZXGiant)

December 29, 2009 - MZX 2.83

It's been a year since the last release, due in part to my reduced free
time, and less contribution from other developers in 2009. I'd also like
to believe that 2.82b was such a good release, there was no need to rush.

There's over 30 bugs fixed this time. A few features I had to withhold for
2.82b have been added; sample loop markers and some changes to the board
file format necessitated the bump to 2.83. Logicow's GLSL renderer has
finally made it in (various bits had to be re-written to extend
portability to other platforms).

There's a new (semi-complete) Android port this time; I hope to complete
it, and provide binaries for Android 2.0 phones, in 2.83b.

Thanks go out to the usual suspects -- Terryn, Mr_Alert, Logicow, kvance,
Lancer-X, revvy and Exophase -- for supporting development this year.

USERS

+ Added support for loop markers in WAV and OGG files. The WAV loop support uses
  the "smpl" chunk used by ModPlug Tracker and Wavosaur among others. Only the
  first loop is used, and only forward looping is supported. The OGG loop
  support uses the "LOOPSTART" and "LOOPLENGTH" tags as used by RPG Maker VX.
  (Mr_Alert)
+ Added OpenGL Shader Language (glsl) renderer which uses shaders to render
  and scale the video. This renderer is compatible with Open GL >=2.0 and
  Open GL-ES 2.0 video cards only. A variety of shader programs have been
  provided and these can be customized. Performance of all MZX modes
  (including SMZX) is excellent. (Logicow, ajs)
+ Files will no longer be silently overwritten by save dialogs if the user
  enters an existing filename without the default extension. (revvy)
+ The string editor in the counter debug menu (F11) now escapes newlines
  and backslashes to prevent UI corruption.
+ Fix a bug where the LOAD_GAME counter handler could continue to use the
  old board state after load, causing crashes. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where status counters containing numbers >6 characters would
  cause MegaZeux to crash or behave strangely.
+ Fix a bug in the robot editor's find/replace function that caused crashes
  when replacing a string with another longer string, with a replacement at
  the end of a line.
+ Programmatically writing to a read-only "built-in" counter will no longer
  allocate it general heap space. This prevents writes from showing up in
  the F11 counter debugger that are inaccessible from robotic.
+ Fix a bug that caused the SMZX mode 3 palette to become corrupted upon
  entering the char editor (the editor would re-write colours 2-4 and not
  restore them from backup correctly).
+ Fix a bug where a robot program would never progress if the subroutine
  stack was popped more times than it was pushed (via return or top).
+ On UNIX platforms a desktop/menu entry is now installed by default, using
  the existing icon. (Sci-freak)
+ Clamp score to >= 0 if world <= 2.70. Fixes "Gates: The Puzzles" and
  possibly other old titles depending on this behavior. (Exophase)
+ Fullscreen modes will now automatically use your current desktop resolution
  if using any hardware renderer (i.e. not the default software renderer). To
  get the old behaviour back you must set fullscreen_resolution explicitly.
+ Fix a bug where web and thick web would be treated the same.
+ Fixed a bug in the updater where modified/replaced files would be considered
  for deletion.
+ Fixed a bug on case-sensitive filesystems where saving a game, world or MZM
  could fail to overwrite any existing file by the same name (if matched
  case insensitively).
+ Do not apply masking to chars 32-127 in signs or scrolls when playing a
  world. Previously, even the mask_midchars option would have no effect on
  the display of signs or scrolls. This has been broken since 2.80g.
+ Re-work board editor's Alt+H option to provide minimal editor (one row)
  status info, rather than completely hiding the help.
+ The checkres utility now checks the global robot and custom sfx tables
  for missing resources.
+ Chests can be added with Hi Bombs (omission noted by zzo38).
+ Fix IF c?? Sprite p?? # # "label" so that a non-wildcard parameter is
  respected (previously it would always just check sprite 0).
+ NDS port updated from dsmzx2 release. (kvance, ajs)
+ Updated SDL to 1.2.14 in Windows x86, Windows x64 and Mac OS X builds.
+ Security checks are no longer applied to filenames in module or sample
  playback in "listening only" modes in the editor.
+ Module volume is applied immediately before playback upon switching boards.
  This prevents one cycle of audio "leaking" at the wrong volume.
+ Prevent crash with negative string clip where clip + offset = 0. Clip is
  now correctly limited to total string length.
+ Help file is now optional for MZXRun, even with CONFIG_HELPSYS=1 builds.
+ Fix crash when robot editor macros expanded other macros.
+ The lock icon is no longer missing from the Items THING menu (F4).
+ A world to start up with can now be passed to megazeux without the
  startup_file= prefix. This makes megazeux consistent with other
  applications.
+ SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE, SHOOTSEEKER and SPITFIRE now end the cycle, to restore
  compatibility with pre-port MZX and fix games such as Kya's Sword and
  Stones & Roks II.
+ Have IF [dir] PLAYER [color] [thing] [param] "label" interpret SEEK
  direction wrt robot coordinates, rather than player coordinates.
  Other directions are not affected.
+ Zapping a label at the end of a robot program will no longer corrupt the
  robot list, usually causing crashes.
+ Entering lines in the robot editor with leading or trailing spaces will be
  trimmed before the line is compiled.
+ The single quote characters encasing S_CHARACTER parameters in the robot
  editor will now use the protected (GUI) charset rather than the game one.
+ Add a "system_mouse" config.txt option that allows the mouse cursor to be
  replaced with the system mouse cursor, rather than being drawn by MegaZeux.
+ Disallow placing player clones with SET "board_id" 127.
+ Relaxed file name limit on board MOD file. The board MOD can now be as long
  as the limit imposed by file dialog's input box (previously limited to 12
  characters).
+ Truncation of currently open input/output file names will now only occur
  at MAX_PATH bytes (typically 512 characters). The previous limit was 13
  characters.
+ Relaxed limit of INPUT string and bottom ("*") messages from 80 characters
  to ROBOT_MAX_TR (512) characters. In the case of bottom messages this can
  be usefully exploited to ~200 characters.
+ Progress meter will be shown for world decrypt on console platforms.
+ Fix a bug where a malformatted BMP header would be written (length too
  short, didn't include dummy channel in BMP palette). (Mr_Alert)
+ Optimize audio locking; do file I/O outside of critical sections to
  decrease stalling, particularly on platforms with slow I/O. (Mr_Alert)
+ Added support for MacOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and removed support for 10.3.
+ Loading a save game from robotic will now correctly restore intensities
  to their saved values.
+ Copy/pasting a block either with COPY BLOCK or the editor, where the
  copy would exceed the limit on robots/signs/scrolls/sensors, will no
  longer place junk at the target co-ordinates. Instead, the object's
  background will be copied in isolation.
+ Pasting from the clipboard, expanding a macro,  or importing .txt
  or .bc files that would cause a robot to exceed the 64k limit now has
  the operation ignored at the point it exceeds the limit, rather than
  adding an unlimited number of unrecognized lines.
+ Fix a bug with the pc_speaker_on option which could cause the audio
  thread to block indefinitely when PC speaker audio was disabled.

DEVELOPERS

+ MZXRun compilation can now be disabled. Compilation of pre-2.82b style
  non-modular builds requires `--disable-modular --disable-mzxrun'.
+ Disabling SDL can now be done with --disable-sdl and the resulting
  configuration will automatically disable any SDL-dependent components.
  This is useless to anybody except developers doing new ports.
+ Game directory, utility directory and resource directories can now
  be specified and will be respected on "make install". (Sci-freak, ajs)
+ Added experimental port to Android. See arch/android/README for more
  information.
+ Ported opengl1 and opengl2 renderers to OpenGL ES 1.x and glsl renderer
  to OpenGL ES 2.0, used increasingly by mobile devices.
+ Removed SDL dependency from NDS port. It only used it for timing and
  stuffed events.
+ On Windows platforms, binaries are processed with the `pefix' in-tree
  tool to eliminate data section differences in programs with identical
  texts. This minimizes the amount of content required to be sent for
  updates.
+ Updated Wii port: improved audio and video support, added USB mouse
  support, numerous optimizations and improved file selector. (Mr_Alert)

December 29, 2008 - MZX 2.82b

This release contains plenty of important bug fixes, ranging from regressions
such as the broken command-line editor macro expansion to third party bugs
like the Windows "directx" SDL video driver breakage.

There are also some new ports and features. MegaZeux now runs on the Wii (port
by Mr_Alert) and AmigaOS 4.x (port by myself and Spot from os4depot). The
Windows x64 port has matured immensely and can now be considered stable.
MacOS X builds now have clipboard support. The hardware stretching renderers
now have a couple of fixed aspect ratio modes.

The biggest feature of this release is the introduction of a portable network
layer, which is currently being tested by the new built-in updater (F7/U).

Internally, MegaZeux is now modularized and builds as several DLL and EXE
files, which should make redesigning parts like the help system and editor
a little easier, as well as allowing us to ship a "mzxrun" executable for
the first time since 2.69c. This "mzxrun" executable is now used by a
majority of the console ports.

Contributions from Revvy, Mr_Alert, Terryn and Exophase have helped make
this another solid release.

USERS

+ Writing to $str.length (which previously did undefined things) will now
  truncate or enlarge the string to the size specified.
+ Removed filename size limit for FWRITE_MODIFY and FWRITE_APPEND. (Revvy)
+ Added support to the checkres tool to check worlds in non-local
  directories. (Revvy)
+ Fix an old bug with saving games and worlds from Robotic where a board could
  be prematurely "optimized", renumbering robot IDs within the same cycle. For
  commands like DIE this could cause unpredictable behaviour or simply crashes
  (if invoked in the same cycle). As a special case, end the cycle if either
  of these SET specials are used.
+ Mistaken or malicious file I/O such as set "$test" to "fread(-1>>1)" will
  no longer crash MegaZeux. The read size will be truncated to a contextual
  maximum for the current file.
+ Fixed a crash using "fwrite0" in conjunction with an empty string.
+ Fixed a bug where checking sprite_collisions on a disabled target sprite
  would unconditionally trigger (regardless of whether a collision was
  present or not).
+ Un-group the handling of the KEY and KEYn counters so that different
  compatibility checks can be applied to either counter. Fixes
  "Bocco Chronicles 1" and probably several other titles.
+ Fix a crash when using RIDn or ROBOT_ID_n in the same cycle as DIE for
  another robot positioned earlier in the board scan.
+ Fix poor sanity checks on BOARD_ID counter writes. Illegal character IDs such
  as -1 can no longer be used to bypass the check (causing subsequent crashes).
+ Windows builds now use a patched version of SDL 1.2.13 containing a fix
  for the directx+F10 issue.
+ Fix a bug where one robot could send another robot to "#return", with an
  address outside its program. In such cases, the robot will now terminate.
+ A "mzxrun" binary is now shipped alongside the editor-capable MZX binary.
+ Fix TIME/TIMERESET overflows with very large values. Board timeout is now
  programmatically limited to 32767, which is consistent with the Board Info
  control.
+ Clamp CHAR_X/CHAR_Y properly so that negative numbers can no longer be used
  to corrupt the editor charset and potentially other process memory.
+ Fix recent breakage of SHIFT+F{1,2,3,4} so that the percentage time spent
  displaying the original character and the '!' are equal.
+ Remove some bogus handling of lines containing "only" ';', ',' or ' '.
+ Honor user's robot character selection if they are holding shift when
  pressing return or space (would previously always return char 247).
+ Backspacing a line and then expanding a macro no longer restores the
  original line contents immediately after the expansion.
+ MacOS 10.x clipboard support (via Cocoa Pasteboard). Alt+Ins can be entered
  with Fn+Alt+Numpad0 on a Macbook or Powerbook keyboard.
+ Rendering glitches are no longer encountered when using the ' S_CHARACTER.
+ Fix robot editor glitches where the game charset SPACE would be used in
  places where the protected UI charset should be used instead.
+ The introductory help message is displayed if the load dialog is cancelled
  prior to loading a game. Hopefully the screen is now never totally blank.
+ The F7/F8 cheats can now be used freely in MZXRun (in MegaZeux proper they
  remain usable only in editor tests).
+ Saving to a directory above the MegaZeux startup directory, then attempting
  to save to this location again, will no longer crash MegaZeux. Instead, the
  parent directory will be changed into before the dialog is displayed.
+ Fixed numerous crash bugs with the scroll editor; it should be relatively
  usable now.
+ Writing to $str+0 is no longer interpreted in the same way as a plain
  write to $str. Instead, it behaves like writes to non-zero offsets (as more
  of a paste than a replace).
+ Display current X,Y position of robot in the robot editor status bar.
+ Fix directory rename so that it no longer displays garbage and/or crashes
  MegaZeux (Alt+R to rename a directory in any file picker).
+ In the robot editor, lines can now be split at a midpoint with enter and
  two consecutive lines merged together with backspace. (Exophase)
+ Fix use of status counter 6 and display of status counters in general,
  which has been broken since 2.80.
+ Fix swapping to encrypted worlds if initially the user decides to not
  decrypt the world. Previously, this would either crash, or loop forever.
- Removed the legacy "force_resolution" option which was replaced long ago
  by the more accurate "fullscreen_resolution" option.
+ When using the OpenGL or overlay renderers, in either windowed or
  fullscreen mode, the aspect ratio can now be preserved as either 4:3
  (most similar to DOS) or 64:35 (most similar to the port). The display
  will be letterboxed or margins applied as appropriate. See the
  "video_ratio" configuration option for more information.
+ Fixed a bug on some systems where numlock could not be used as a key,
  only as a flag. The numlock "key" is now masked out of "key_code" and
  similar; hopefully this won't break any games.
+ Restored the meter widget from the old DOS MZX for use with the world
  loader and saver routines. This reassures users, especially on consoles,
  where loading a world can take a long time. (Mr_Alert)
+ On Windows, directx.bat now passes %cd% through to `start' so that features
  such as the updater continue to work. (MZXGiant)
+ Pasting into a string with set "$str+N" with an N > str.length will no
  longer crash MZX.
+ "Exit to DOS" is now "Exit MegaZeux" to reflect the multi-platform nature
  of the program.
+ Setting a substring size to zero with $string#0 will no longer return the
  whole string; it will instead return the empty string.
+ Accessing a substring with an offset >= $string.length will no longer return
  the last character from the string; it will instead return the empty string.
+ Writing beyond MAX_STRING_LEN (1MB) or using negative offsets (which has the
  same effect) no longer crashes. Instead, the write is ignored.
+ Fix crash when pasting to and from the same string, specifically in
  conjunction with $str+offset.
+ Fix bug where altering "num" in a GO DIR [num] or WAIT [num] while in
  process could cause the robot to stall forever. The robot will now only
  wait for either the cycles it has waited already, or the current "num"
  at that cycle.

DEVELOPERS

+ Ported to OpenSolaris. You need to install `SUNWxorg-headers' if you want
  X11 clipboard support.
+ Remove dependency on SDL_image on non-win32 platforms when enabling
  the icon branding feature (see pngops.c).
+ Ported to AmigaOS. You need to install the clib2 version of libSDL and
  miniGL, and the build system assumes you are using a cross compiler.
+ Added experimental port to the Wii. See arch/wii/README for more
  information. (Mr_Alert)
+ get_path() in util.c now returns <0 for failure, or the length of the path
  for the given file. (Revvy)
+ Add a valgrind.supp file to suppress bugs in third party libraries when
  valgrinding MegaZeux.
+ Cleaned up all the ports and documented making new ports. The platforms
  "linux", "solaris" and "obsd" are now called "unix" and the "linux-static"
  platform is now "unix-devel" and available on all UNIX derivatives/clones.
+ Add a special hack to enable linking with --as-needed for DT_NEEDED link
  optimization for GNU ld platforms.
+ Updated MSVC projects. Fixed all warnings emitted by MSVC 2008, and
  implemented icon support with existing mingw resource files.
+ Use the GNU ld "debuglink" feature on all platforms to enable shipping of
  a side-by-side symbol package. Optimized release builds can now be
  debugged with minimal user effort.
- Removed HOST_CC feature for cross compilation; since the utilities now
  intimately depend on the MZX runtime, they must be built with the same
  compiler.
+ MegaZeux now provides the option for "modular" linkage, factoring out the
  "core", "editor" and "network" features to shared objects that other
  binaries can link against. This feature works on the unix, mingw,
  amiga and darwin ports.
+ Added RPM .spec file. Capable of building (at least) Fedora 10 RPMs.

June 10, 2008 - MZX 2.82

Despite the increase in minor version, this release mostly targets bug and
regression fixes. However, there ARE some additional new features, such as
the introduction of the LOAD_MENU and mouse pixel counters, and refinement
of the {FREAD,FWRITE}_COUNTER counter. (There are several other smaller
features that are documented in the changelog.)

SAVs from older worlds (requiring compatibility hacks) no longer fail to
play (Darkness, etc. are affected). We've also done a good bit to fix
compatibility with 2.70 and older.

A new tool, "checkres", is now routinely packaged, allowing you to check
your games for missing resource files (PALs, CHRs, etc.) before passing
them on to other people. This should be especially handy for DoZ game
submissions.

The Nintendo DS port (Kevin Vance's "DsMZX") has been merged into this
release. I'll provide binaries for GP2X, PSP and NDS this time, but I
can't guarantee they'll work.

Both of the snags from the last DoZ have been addressed -- the help system
should no longer crash and the Block Action crashes should be reduced in
frequency. However, there are still issues with pasting in the robot editor
that remain unfixed (they're just really hard to reproduce). With your bug
reports, I look forward to fixing this.

As usual, thanks go out to Revvy and Mr_Alert for their contributions to
the bug-fixing effort, and to Terryn for his unwavering dedication to
creating and organising bug reports, and for testing our bug fixes.

USERS

+ Fixed and improved quality of the half-width renderer for the GP2X port
  (Mr_Alert).
+ Have the numpad work correctly when numlock is disabled. Keys are no longer
  ignored by the MZX editor, and games should recognize them as before.
+ Added a tool, "checkres", which extracts all resources from a MegaZeux
  world or board file and lists them (or lists only those which are not
  found in the game directory. ZIP files are also supported (to a more
  limited extent) (ajs & Revvy, ideas from Exophase & Terryn).
+ Removed the bogus "F1 for Help" option from error dialogs, and finally
  get rid of the "** BETA **" banner on title boards in play mode.
+ Obsolete support for the AMS, DBM, DMF, MDL, MT2, PSM, PTM and UMX module
  formats. As noted for several versions in the help file, these are not
  loadable by MikMod. It is extremely unlikely any game uses these obscure
  formats, but denying their use is now enforced (at a robotic level).
+ Fix crash when writing to a MZX string at an illegal offset (< 0).
+ Fix returning from a subroutine invoked by a jump from a MZX text box
  class command so that it no longer skips the next impending line (after
  the text box).
+ Assemble single non-alphanum/punctuation characters as bytecode CHARACTER
  instead of bytecode STRING. Fixes bogus auto-quoting for commands like
  SCROLL CHAR (Revvy).
+ Switch the Win32 package back to using the "windib" SDL video driver,
  instead of the "directx" SDL video driver. The windib.bat file has been
  replaced with directx.bat, which has opposing semantics.
+ SAM/GDMs with converted WAV/S3M counterparts of zero length will be
  automatically re-converted. This hack can be used to procedurally
  regenerate WAV files from SAMs, or transparently work around on-disk
  corruption.
+ Strings are now limited to a maximum length of 1M. I'm open to suggestions
  over a better limit, but there must be a limit (set "$string.X" notation
  grows a string arbitrarily, so robotic can crash MZX when a string is resized
  beyond a reasonable limit).
+ Strings, when grown, will fill gaps with ' ' instead of garbage. This can be
  useful when the string grows after using the set "$string.X" notation; the
  rest of the string is no longer garbage, allowing the debugger to be used.
+ A robot that does a "put c?? Thing p?? [dir] player" and overwrites itself
  will no longer leak commands. Instead, if the robot overwrites itself, its
  program will end.
+ Fix message edges always showing up black, instead of whatever color 0
  is. (Revvy)
+ Change starting/max health and lives minimum to 1 instead of 0. (Revvy)
+ Some help system (F1) bugs have been fixed, hopefully mitigating some of
  the crashes people have been seeing.
+ Fix a bug on Linux where fclose() on a robot-opened file could, on world
  reload, occassionally crash (due to a stale handle). Fixes loading Toayarin
  saves multiple times in a row.
+ The new option "gl_vsync" has been added to allow the SDL "flip on vsync"
  in the OpenGL renderers to be forcibly enabled or disabled. This fixes a
  problem where speed 1 would only be as fast as the video refresh rate.
+ Setting the music volume to 0 (when using the ModPlug engine) now ensures
  that no music is audible. Previously, setting the volume to 0 would be
  equivalent to setting the volume to 1, which was still audible.
+ Upon exiting the initial load screen, and not entering the editor, the
  screen is now updated. This fixes rendering glitches in the MZX game
  window when overlapping the window with another, at the slight expense
  of CPU time.
+ If loading a save game from the title screen (or when no world has been
  loaded) do not send JUSTENTERED to all robots. This restores compatibility
  with MZX 2.70 and is consistent with loading a save from another board.
+ Counters with 10 digits and a negative sign are no longer truncated in
  the debug menu.
+ Correctly clamp (rather than truncate) the value passed through to a
  SET COLOR. Restores compatibility with 2.70, and fixes Xenogenesis.
+ Improve clipboard copy behaviour on Linux. Some actions are still
  mysteriously broken.
+ Fix replacing with a blank string in conjunction with the replace all
  Ctrl+F action in the robot editor. The cursor can now no longer become
  negative, fixing numerous possible crashes on search/replace.
+ Fix loading the intrinsic SMZX palette when switching to SMZX modes
  from a game not in the same directory as the "smzx.pal" file.
+ Reloading a world that requires switching between SMZX and non-SMZX modes
  will now respect the world's intrinsic palette on the title screen. Fixes
  problems loading non-SMZX games after having an SMZX game loaded.
+ Clamp array offsets on boards. Some older MZX worlds are corrupted and
  have the endgame_{x,y} coordinates outside of the limits of the endgame
  board. Fixes "Fourth Power".
+ Where possible, version all counters that the port understands. This
  ensures that in the unlikely case that a game made with an older version
  of MZX (actually, with an older world magic) uses a counter that did not
  exist in that game's era, the port will no longer try to interpret it.
  Previously, only rid? and key? were versioned.
+ SAV files will now be stamped with the world magic of the world they
  were loaded from. This allows compatibility hacks to apply to SAV files
  as they would to worlds. (ajs, Terryn, Mr_Alert)
+ Add LOAD_MENU counter like ENTER_MENU, F2_MENU et al. to allow control
  (from robotic) over whether the LOAD_MENU can be brought up.
+ Have FREAD_COUNTER and FWRITE_COUNTER read in a DOS dword (32bit) instead
  of a DOS word (16bit). This allows modern post-port MZX counters to be
  fully represented in files. Compatibility with older worlds is preserved.
+ Add a new config option "board_editor_hide_help" which changes the default
  hide setting of the help text on the primary board editor.
+ Numerous fixes for bugs found by valgrind. (Nightwatch)
+ Icon support is now fixed and works on all platforms. On Windows, the
  icon cannot currently be changed (it is loaded from the EXE's resource
  section). Use ResHacker if you really want to change it.
+ Fixed a bug where either LOAD_ROBOTn or LOAD_BCn (where n was equal to
  ROBOT_ID) would alter the robot's line number rather than completely restart
  it. Due to complexities in robot context, this lead to the first line being
  skipped.
+ Added a new tool "downver" which supports drag-and-drop downgrading of
  a world or board from the version of MZX it is packaged with to the
  previous version of MZX. This tool may be unsafe to use -- be careful.
+ Fixed a bug in the robotic assembler which would occassionally emit corrupt
  programs with SAVE_ROBOT. These programs, if loaded by LOAD_ROBOT could
  cause a crash.
+ Added a config.txt (or command line) option "startup_editor" which, if set
  to a non-zero value, will start MegaZeux in the editor with a blank world.
+ Fix a bug where a robot's WALK processing, on entering a transporter, could
  allow subsequent commands (such as GO) to corrupt the board. WALK now ends
  the cycle in the special case that a robot goes through a transporter.
+ You can now directly import bytecode into the robot editor via the Alt+I
  menu. The extension for the bytecode file must .bc for it to be loaded.
+ A game loading SAVs via the LOAD_GAME counter will no longer crash MZX
  if the SAV attempted is from an incompatible version of MZX, or in any
  way corrupted.
+ Fix a crash when auto-completing lines that were greater than 241 characters
  in length after completion.
+ Added mouse pixel counters MOUSEPX and MOUSEPY. (Mr_Alert)
+ Commenting a line of maximum length (241 characters) can no longer grow the
  length of the line beyond this limit.
+ Fixed a bug causing the software renderer to fail to center when using a
  boxed fullscreen resolution. Also fixes a bug where the PSP platform would
  ignore an override of the force_bpp option. (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed a bug causing macros loaded from config.txt to be expanded
  incorrectly. Relatedly, fixed a bug where #<string> in the robot exitor
  would "disappear" on entry, if there was no correspondingly named macro.

DEVELOPERS

+ Don't initialize the SDL audio subsystem if audio is permanently disabled
  with --disable-audio.
+ Add fixes for OpenBSD to allow PNG screenshots and X11 clipboard support to
  work. Tested with OpenBSD 4.2 and GCC 3.3.5.
+ Updated Win32 builds with SDL 1.2.13.
+ Dependencies are now correctly tracked in the build system. Modifying a
  header will automatically regenerate the minimal set of object files that
  depend on this header.
+ Out of the box MSVC support. The file "msvc.zip" in the root of the source
  package now provides a Visual Studio 2005 project and pre-compiled
  dependencies. There may be stability issues with the resulting binary.
  See also the documentation in arch/msvc/README.txt.
+ The Nintendo DS port (a.k.a. 'dsmzx') has been merged. This is the most
  exotic port thus far, and adds features such as player focus (on the second
  display). Sound isn't working yet, and large games still won't play (due to
  lack of memory). See docs/nds.txt for more information. (kvance)
+ Many stack-heavy functions have been de-bloated and allocate large storage
  on the heap (if performance is not critical). This helps out platforms
  with a small, fixed stack size (such as NDS).
+ The built-in help system can now be disabled for embedded platforms.
  The startup check for the help file will not be performed if the help
  system is disabled, and so this file can be omitted from distributions.
+ The package.sh script now supports OS X, PSP, GP2X and NDS packaging.
+ The OS X port no longer requires Xcode. The new build system and package.sh
  can create a universal Application and corresponding DMG file. The new
  infrastructure deprecates the old macosx.zip method.
+ Most of the internal dependency on SDL has been removed. Therefore, MZX
  can be built (but not yet work) without SDL present. The only remaining
  component to convert is MikMod, but this can be disabled, so port authors
  can start using the feature right away (see config.sh). (Mr_Alert)

December 8, 2007 - MZX 2.81h

Another bugfix release with a couple of new features, in time for the
Winter 2007 Dualstream Day of Zeux. The major new features of this release
are automatic module renaming in the editor, PNG screenshots and many
improvements to MZX on embedded platforms (like PSP and DS).

MegaZeux can now be compiled in MZXRun mode (like the old DOS
implementation) and by disabling features such as unnecessary renderers
and audio support, can be made approximately 70% smaller.

Thanks again to Terryn for relentlessly tracking down many serious bugs;
we've tried to fix all the issues that have crept up in the last 5 months.

Thanks too to Exophase, Mr_Alert and Wervyn for contributing to this
release; your time and help is invaluable.

Happy Holidays!

USERS

+ Added a more lenient WAV file loader so that ModPlug isn't relied on as much
  to play malformed WAV files (mostly old SAM conversions) (Mr_Alert).
+ Added SCORE and mzx_speed to the counter debugger (Mr_Alert, ajs).
+ Added a 16-bit software renderer and a half-width renderer for the GP2X port
  (Mr_Alert).
+ Made the mouse cursor in the "opengl2" renderer look more like the mouse
  cursor in the other renderers (Mr_Alert).
+ Setting vlayer_size, vlayer_width or vlayer_height to values less than or
  equal to zero would crash MegaZeux. Limit the smallest vlayer size to 1x1.
+ Setting vlayer_width or vlayer_height to a value larger than vlayer_size
  would crash MegaZeux. Limit the largest size of either dimension to a 
  maximum of vlayer_size.
+ If selecting a module with a non 8.3 filename, MZX will now ask you if you
  want to rename it to 8.3, and do so in an intelligent way. This means that
  music can be selected in the editor and correctly saved (Wervyn).
+ The OpenBSD compiler detected some serious string bugs in MegaZeux. These
  have now been fixed and should eliminate some more potential crashes.
+ Fixed a bug where an ENERGIZER item or use of the INVINCO counter would
  cause the original player color to be corrupted at the end of the colour
  blitz.
+ Fixed a long-standing bug where set "$string" to "FWRITEn" would be
  cheerfully ignored.
+ Fixed a bug where a corrupt robot list could crash MegaZeux (e.g. the
  list from Star Quest from DoZ'02).
+ FEATURE: Screenshots are now saved in a palettized PNG file format. For
  platforms without libpng, PNG support can be compiled out, and BMP will
  be used instead.
+ Fixed a bug where changing boards in the editor could sometimes corrupt
  memory, later causing a crash (either testing or coming out of testing a
  board).
+ Fixed a sensor bug that happens when a sensor can't go anywhere it is told
  to, and the player is on it (Exophase).
+ Fixed using ABORT LOOP in some situations. Using it outside of a loop
  still has undefined semantics and this has been documented in the help
  file (Exophase).
+ Setting a board option below its numeric limit is no longer
  possible (Exophase).
+ Fixed problems with going over Robot name character limits using the .@
  command (Exophase).
+ Fixed problems with LOAD_ROBOT freezing on a robot with no newline at the
  end of the file.
+ Fixed a problem with "Replace All" in the robotic editor, that could
  sometimes cause a line to exceed 240 characters and crash the editor.
+ Fixed a problem with "Replace" in the robotic editor, which could cause a
  line to temporarily become 241 characters and then truncate silently to
  240 characters.
+ Fix a bug that caused the original game palette to be lost when testing
  a game in the editor that switched between Regular/SMZX1 and SMZX2/3 modes.
  MegaZeux should now try much harder to preserve the user palette,
  regardless of game edits.
+ Fix a bug causing board switching to not correctly alter the x,y viewport
  scroll leading to the display of raw memory and potentially crashes, with
  differently sized boards.
+ Fixed stack corruption caused by SCROLL CHAR SOUTH, detected by Ubuntu's
  SSP (Stack Smashing Protection) enabled binary.

DEVELOPERS

+ Made the build system less verbose by default (like Linux). This should help
  make warnings (due to coding errors) easier to identify. If you don't like
  the new syntax, or need the command debug, you can build with "make V=1".
+ Updated Win32 builds with SDL 1.2.12.
+ Rewrote the build system to not use recursive Makefiles. Variable propagation
  was starting to be a problem, and recursive designs are generally discouraged.
+ Refactored the graphics rendering code to modularize the renderers and reduce
  code duplication (Mr_Alert).
+ GDM2S3M switched over to use inttypes.h instead of home-brew types.
+ MegaZeux now compiles on OpenBSD (and probably other BSDs).
+ Made all unnecessary global symbols static. This should improve compiler
  optimisations and correctness (Mr_Alert, ajs).
+ Fix compilation of MegaZeux against SDL 1.3 SVN. However, this SDL version
  is still in development, and MegaZeux does not work correctly when compiled
  against it.
+ MegaZeux now builds with the experimental MINGW-x64 branch, enabling x64
  binaries for Windows.
+ MegaZeux now builds with MSVC if you apply the patch from contrib/,
    megazeux-r326-replace-c99-variable-arrays-with-malloc-free.diff
  This patch is required for MSVC because it makes non-compiler-specific
  changes (which involve converting from C99 variable length arrays to
  malloc/free) which are slower and should not be used with competent
  C99 compilers like GCC.
  Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition 2005 was used to build libogg,
  libvorbis, libsdl and MegaZeux itself. Only 32bit builds were tested.
+ MegaZeux now has size optimisations which can reduce binary size when
  features are disabled. For example, all renderers can now be disabled,
  and when module engines are disabled, audio will not export any symbols.
+ The entire audio subsystem can now be disabled. This further reduces
  binary size on embedded platforms. However, SFX editing still remains
  enabled (though useless) until editor modularity is implemented.
+ The PSP port is now officially supported, and compiles out of the box.
  See docs/psp.txt.
+ Renamed macos platform "darwin", to reflect its true nature (use Xcode to
  build as a real Application, instead of just a UNIX binary). Also fixed
  some bogosities with robo_ed's X11 includes on OS 10.5.
+ The editor can now be disabled, a la MZXRUN from the old DOS versions.
  Configure with --disable-editor to shrink MZX by about 150k.
+ MegaZeux can now be compiled with size optimisations (--optimize-size to
  config.sh) for a 20% space saving.
+ MegaZeux's core now builds with -W (basically all GCC warnings) plus
  some additional warnings that aren't switched on by this flag. All
  warnings have been fixed.

July 4, 2007 - MZX 2.81g

Again, no significant new features have been introduced in this release.
However, there have been many essential bugfixes, including improved
compatibility with games made in older versions of MegaZeux.

Additionally, improvements have been made to the opengl2 and overlay2
renderers, improving performance for most users. A port of MegaZeux to the
GP2X console has been added. MegaZeux has been backported to C (rather than
C++) and can operate correctly on a CPU without a floating-point unit.

Particular thanks go out to Mr_Alert (for his valuable bug fixes),
Lancer-X (for fixing what I was too lazy to) and Terryn (for finding many
annoying bugs that nobody else could).

USERS

+ Fixed a bug in the audio code. The linear resampler was not taking volume
  into account, which broke changing the volume of samples (WAV and Vorbis)
  which cannot natively alter their volumes.
+ Fixed a regression in the overlay editor caused by the new editor space
  semantics.
+ Screenshots are now rendered to a separate texture using the 8bit software
  renderer. This means that the hardware scalers will not affect the quality
  of the screenshot. It also fixes a bug when using opengl2, which would dump
  only a white screen.
+ Temporarily reverted a bugfix that broke Zeux IV - Forest of Ruin. I'm not
  dropping the bugfix, I just can't immediately see what's wrong.
+ Fixed a bug where setting the viewport to negative coordinates would crash
  MegaZeux. There was code to handle this, but it was wrong.
+ Fixed a bug that permitted the mouse y coordinate to be warped to row 25,
  which does not exist. This bug caused some of the renderers to crash, and
  the software renderer to draw in memory it did not possess.
+ Fixed a bug where games made before 2.68 could have available the "key?"
  counters, unsupported in that version. This caused collisions with counters
  with the key? name used with inc/dec/mul/div/mod. Fixes "Doom Keep".
+ Imported libmodplug 0.8.4, which adds MIDI/PAT and ABC format support,
  fixes some bugs in the mixer, and should build on more platforms.
  NOTE: MID files currently cannot be selected in the editor, because they
        do not play correctly.
+ Improved the performance of the "opengl2" renderer, by removing the
  convoluted 3D drawing commands and replacing them with 2D ones. Reduced the
  quad count by using an intermediary 80x25 texture. MegaZeux now depends on
  fewer GL features (LogiCow).
+ Introduced an "fsafegets" to work around problems where robots exported by
  a Windows version of MegaZeux would not load on other platforms. This was
  due to differing EOL style and broke at least one game (Termination).
+ Renamed "force_resolution" to "fullscreen_resolution" to better match its
  semantics with the scaling renderers. The new name is less accurate for
  software render modes, but most people using software will not want to
  change it from the default anyway.
+ Fix a bug where the variable-length string allocator would prematurely
  bail out when reading a string (of indeterminate length) from a file with
  the set "$var" to "FREAD" syntax.
+ Fix a bug where more than 256 errors would crash the robotic checker.
+ Improved performance of the overlay2 (faster) renderer (Mr_Alert).
+ Make the transparent overlay "really" transparent when used in conjunction
  with sprites (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug reported by Mr_Alert where MZX would not handle short,
  non-looping mods in the editor. The editor would try to destroy the mod
  again, even after the callback had destroyed it (premature termination).
+ Fixed a bug with SWAP WORLD where file translation would occur but the
  result would mistakenly not be used. This broke some uses of SWAP WORLD
  on non-Windows platforms (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where using JUMP to MOD ORDER right after switching boards
  would fail due to the board music not having been loaded yet (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where games made before 2.80 would inadvertently trigger
  "PLAYERHURT" due to using the SET command to reduce the amount of
  health (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where player clones where generated when entering transports
  during FREEZETIME (Lancer-X).
+ Debug menu is now eradicated on leaving the editor (Lancer-X).
+ Debug menu is now properly painted over when the board size is < the editor
  viewport. Fixes various graphical glitches (Lancer-X).
+ Fix a crash bug when playing older MZX games from read-only media (such as a
  CD) or where file-system permissions prohibited creating SAM conversions
  (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed bug where certain file formats would not be automatically converted
  if their extensions were mixed or upper case (e.g. OGG/SAM/GDM).
+ Restored functionality of "if lasttouched DIR" which has been broken since
  MZX 2.02.
+ Fixed a bug where attempting to decrypt a read-only world file would result
  in a crash (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed several bugs where an error loading a world file would result in
  crashes in several different situations (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where a robot using the BECOME command to change into a
  PushableRobot or vice versa would freeze (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed memory leaks in the file selection dialog, the counter debugger, the
  collision list and the global robot (Mr_Alert).
+ Updated counter list (see docs/counter_list.txt in the source) (Terryn).
+ Fixed a bug where pressing escape when editing the effect of a ring or potion
  would result in an invalid parameter which would later cause a crash if
  edited again (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug in which robot-driven text boxes using option commands (the ?
  command) could overflow by two characters and spill over the side (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed the list box searching mechanism (used in the file manager and F11
  counter list) and made the existing function more understandable. (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed a bug in which the message string given to the 'ask' command could
  spill over. Now, the 'ask' dialog resizes if possible, and clips when no
  further resizing can be performed (Lancer-X).
+ Clipped the 'input string' message properly, to prevent similar overflow.
+ Fixed a bug with the EXPLODE, DIE, DIE ITEM and BECOME commands when used
  with the global robot (would clear the global robot, eventually corrupting
  memory when in the editor). Presumably, these commands are bogus for the
  global robot, and have been disabled.

DEVELOPERS

+ Rewrote config.sh to use POSIX sh compatible functions, so that there is
  no dependency on the BASH interpreter. Surprisingly, some distributions
  still don't enable BASH by default (using csh, ash or zsh instead).
+ Ported most of MegaZeux back to C. This should further reduce the platform
  requirements for running MZX, and enable marginally faster compilation.
+ Enabled GCC's -W flag for even more warnings, switching off unused
  parameter warnings (useful for delegates). Mostly typing fixes, but it
  found a bug in string handling.
+ No longer suppress char-subscript warnings, and fix up any remaining
  abuses in the tree.
+ Add manpages for 'megazeux' and other binaries for the Debian packages.
  Comply with the Debian packaging guidelines by providing a copyright
  note, listing significant contributors to MegaZeux.
+ Added support to the build system for supporting icons modularly.
  See contrib/icons/README for more information.
+ The debug build (make DEBUG=1) now enables GCC 4.x's stack protector. This
  breaks compatibility with GCC 3.x, but you can just remove the flag if you
  don't want to use it (the stack protector will improve stack corruption
  detection and provide more usable debug traces).
+ Custom Random() implementation to provide a more uniform number
  distribution. Factored out for future (better) implementations.
+ The audio backend (audio.cpp) has been modularised to support the use of
  mikmod instead of modplug. This should enable ports of MZX to platforms
  without an FPU, and improve performance on platforms with weak FPUs.
+ Added GP2X port to config.sh, based on work done by Simon Parzer.

January 30, 2007 - MZX 2.81f

This release is mostly about the new renderers, the first of which was
introduced in the previous version. There's also a few important bugfixes,
and a lot of internal tidy-up work. I'd like to thank Mr_Alert, Quantum P.
and LogiCow for contributing to this release. Thanks guys.

USERS

+ Renamed the force_32bpp config option to force_bpp, in preparation for
  16bit OpenGL render modes. This option now takes 8, 16 or 32. 16 is
  reportedly broken on Windows, so stick to 32 for now.
- The force_height_multiplier option has been removed. A lot of code
  wasn't properly designed to handle it, there have been mouse warp bugs
  with it for years, and nobody seems to use it. If people want stretching,
  they can choose one of the four hardware renderers to achieve this.
+ Added infrastructure for "pluggable" renderers. This code isn't perfect,
  but it's far better than the mess in 'e'. Defaults to the 'software'
  render mode.
+ Added Logicow's alternative OpenGL renderer. For more information about
  this renderer, see config.txt. NOTE: This code may be buggy! Please test!
+ Added Mr Alert's YUV overlay renderers. One does full YUV macropixel
  approximation, the other (faster) render does chroma supersampling. See
  config.txt for more information. NOTE: This code may be buggy! Please test!
+ Simplified Exophase's OpenGL renderer present in 'e', and fixed a few bugs
  that caused it to not work for some people.
+ Really made MegaZeux use 'directx' by default on Windows. The code in 'e'
  was non-functional. Use 'windib.bat' to run MegaZeux with the SDL windib
  driver.
+ The OpenGL renderers now have a 'filter' option that allows you to choose
  linear (where pixels are interpolated, looks "blurred") or nearest (where
  nearest-neighbour approximation occurs, looks "sharp").
+ Mouse warping was broken when using any of the hardware renderers. There
  should be code in there now to take account of this (thanks Mr_Alert).
+ Added an option 'editor_spaces_toggle' which allows you to revert MZX's
  space overwrite behavior to the semantics of 'd' (the feature was
  removed in 'e'). By default, the behavior is unchanged.
+ F6 (the debug menu) can now no longer be enabled anywhere but in the
  editor Alt-T test mode. In 'e', it was possible to enable on the title
  screen, but could not be enabled in a game. Like the cheats, this option
  is now visible only in test mode.
- Removed the 'lame/1337' menu feature.
+ Fixed a bug where the global robot could be exited via some legal commands,
  in an abnormal fashion. The bug resulted in all the code up to the offending
  command being executed over and over.

DEVELOPERS

+ OpenGL can now be disabled via config.sh. This allows MegaZeux ebuilds
  to be constructed on systems that do not have any form of OpenGL support.
  (Although MZX runtime loads the OpenGL library, 'e' required the headers
   to build correctly. This is now no longer the case.)
+ On Windows, due to an ATi driver bug, I have provided a means of linking
  directly to opengl32.dll, instead of relying on the dynamic loader. This
  reduces binary portability, but fixes many bug reports of being unable
  to fullscreen on ATi video cards. See OPENGL_LINKING for more information.
+ Improved support for cross compiling with mingw32 on Linux, combined the
  win32 Makefile with this new support.
+ Rewrote the config.sh script. All of the options have changed, and the
  broken platform auto-detection has been removed. See ./config.sh for more
  information.
+ Rejigged MegaZeux's headers so that they can be used in both C and C++
  mode. Renamed fsafeopen.cpp to fsafeopen.c. Hopefully by 'g' most of
  MegaZeux should be ported back to C, instead of the "C++" it is now.
+ Fixed up the 'txt2hlp' utility which Terryn has been using a version of
  to build the internal MZX help system. This binary is built in the source
  distribution, but it is not distributed with the MegaZeux binaries.
+ Moved some antiquated Greg code out into 'old'. No attempt has been made
  to make it compile, it is provided purely for reference.
+ For the windows binaries, "windib.bat" is now generated by package.sh
  and auto-generated for the name of the MegaZeux executable.
+ Updated Xcode package from Quantum P. (see macosx.zip).

January 18, 2007 - MZX 2.81e

+ Made grabbing in the editor not combine background color, only uses
  "special" in game colors for player, tell me if anything ends up being
  weird because of this.
+ Possibly fixed an obscure bug where moving something happened
  immediately if it was sent to a label by a robot further east/south than
  it and it moved north or west (has to do with the way robots are
  reverse scanned). Tell me if this changed any behavior for the worse and
  I'll change it back or try to work out something new.
+ Added GDMs to ctrl + n, this will of course auto convert and play the
  s3m.
+ Added ability to preset player locked status from board settings.
- Removed ability to change SMZX mode ingame (F11)
+ Instead added ability to debug variables (counters and strings)
  ingame with F11. There's also an option to export the current variables
  to Robotic program that sets them.
+ Fixed bug where moving a block with the player into an overlapping
  region leaves a space where the player was.
+ Fixed bug with a robot indirectly sending itself to a subroutine via
  send all or send name causing it to loop the send.
+ Added compatability hacks for key# prior to MZX 2.69 worlds and
  ridNAME falling through in MZX 2.70 and earlier worlds.
+ F6, F7, F8, and F11 debug/cheat keys only work in editing mode now
  (as things were prior to the port) You can still save/load in the editor
  so if you want all of these things you can play the game from the start
  there.
+ Space in the editor no longer deletes something of similar type that is
  beneath not sure what the point of this was anyway.
+ Fixed bug causing cursor to clipped be out of bounds in SMZX char editor
  if changing to smaller multichar edit region.
+ Accidentally messed up screen centering in fullscreen for 32bpp mode,
  fixed.
+ Added hardware scaling option. You can now supply a window resolution
  besides 640x350 and allow for window resizing if hardware scaling is on;
  this will also scale fullscreen output to fill the entire screen. This
  can slow down rendering somewhat.
+ Fixed bug causing flip block to crash in the editor.
+ Made blocked directions relative to the player for put dir player.
+ Fixed bug where putting something to a direction relative the player
  overwriting the robot could crash MZX.
+ Fixed ability to input in input boxes by clicking on their question
  string.
+ Removed the bogus patch to Modplug and correctly fixed it in the build
  system.
+ Added 'debian' subdirectory for building Debian and Ubuntu upstream
  packages. Hopefully MegaZeux will be in the primary pool in a few
  months.
+ Added OS X xcode project files (see 'macosx.zip'). Fixed many bugs
  relating to endian that caused MegaZeux to be buggy on big-endian
  architectures (like PPC). Credit goes to Quantum P for finding these
  bugs and engineering high quality solutions.
+ Made 'directx' the default video render again on Windows. NOTE: This
  overrides the default SDL behaviour, but will not be applied if you
  set SDL_VIDEODRIVER yourself.
+ Repaired the 'linux-static' target so that it no longer includes a
  system C++ library, which caused unpredictable results on distros
  without a static version.
+ Fixed a locking bug with the audio code that caused hangs at startup
  on OS X. Also provided a mutex implementation using GNU pthreads as
  a temporary workaround for an SDL bug on the Linux platform.
+ Added PlayStation Portable (PSP) port. This code was written by Exophase
  and is highly experimental. It may not work at all for you. Please
  see docs/build.txt for more information regarding this port.
+ Fixed mouse movement from being affected by height_multiplier when
  not in fullscreen mode
+ Fixed height_multiplier config.txt option allowing you to enter really
  stupid values (like negatives, 0, and values too large for the
  resolution)
+ Added in an extra video mode check to stop MZX crashing on video modes
  that the video card can not reproduce
+ Fixed Avalanche to a constant placement rate of 1/18 (this caused MZX
  to deliver an uneven number of boulders, and crash with certain board
  sizes
+ Fixed sprite collision box to stop MZX from crashing when stupid values
  are entered
+ Fixed setting the viewport size to weird values like some old MZX games
  do
+ Default fullscreen resolution is now 640x480, this can be changed in
  config.txt
+ The config.txt option force_32bpp is now enabled by default
+ Seeking with mod_position when using a .WAV file as background music
  now works (thanks Mr_Alert)

December 10, 2006 - MZX 2.81d

+ Fixed a compilation failure on Linux, due to SDL no longer depending
  on libX11. Now we manually link X11 into MZX if necessary.
+ Various build system improvements, fixing bugs in the prefixing
  of dependencies.
+ New libmodplug 0.8 imported, fixing many endian problems on big-endian
  machines, integrating all of our local patches to 0.7.
+ Fixed bug causing MZX to freeze when starting up on Win9x machines.
+ Fix a warning generated by GCC 4.1.
+ Update the GPL boilerplates project-wide to the newest FSF address.
+ Fix a string range check causing an obscure crash in certain games.
+ Update the build.txt documentation.
+ Address documentation bugs found in the internal MZX help system (Terryn).
+ Fixed a recently introduced bug breaking the open command.
+ Fixed some bugs with changing params and pressing escape.

December 14, 2005 - MZX 2.81c

+ Oops, accidentally broke shift + F2. Fixed that..
+ Also accidentally broke &+counter& for full hex representation. Fixed.
+ Fixed memory leak problem with playing certain WAVs in a loop.
+ Fixed inconsistency of bad viewport sizes behaving differently on
  current versions from old DOS versions.
+ Accidentally broke joystick stuff in config.txt (has to do with way
  configure options were being read), fixed.
+ Fixed bug causing crash when loading MZBs larger than the current board
  size.
+ Made cursor hidden in alt + V in editor.
+ String comparison failed with nulls in the strings, fixed. Also
  should be slightly more optimal.
+ Fixed bug when using negative numbers for if sprite_colliding "counter"
+ Fixed math operations (inc, dec, etc) not working on string indeces.
+ Added ability to force screen to 32bpp. Fixes some slight rendering
  issues, and if you have problems with fullscreen let me know if this
  helps (try it without first though). See force_32bpp in config.txt.
+ Fixed sprite clipping bug with respect to overlay.
+ Fixed bug where pressing enter on things besides robots, scrolls/signs,
  or sensors in the editor would clear whatever was underneath it.
+ Accidentally broke SFX with optional PC speaker chains (played both,
  should only play PC speaker when digital music is off, fixes Bernard
  the Bard)
+ Made last character in char selection for F3 and alt + C remembered
  (note that they're remembered in two different places for both)
+ Accidentally broke life animations, fixed

November 26, 2005 - MZX 2.81b

+ Fixed inability to make proper .savs of worlds with strings (they'd
  crash when loaded..)
+ Fixed PC speaker audio bug causing a constant high pitched noise to
  be played instead of PC speaker audio sometimes.
+ Fixed some issues with long pathnames.
+ Fixed a bug causing Caverns to crash in recent versions (long story,
  it was most likely due to an error in ver1to2)
+ Now when you set mzx_speed in a game you can no longer change the
  speed from the F2 menu. Setting mzx_speed to 0 reallows this (and
  doesn't set the speed)
+ When loading a game its speed is now set to the speed MZX started
  with (whatever's in config.txt, or the default of 4)
+ Added backup_ext config.txt option to specify the extension of backup
  files (default is .mzx).
+ Fixed backup_interval for config.txt possibly being broken.
+ Fixed a bug messing up the death board on some old MZX games
  (like Nick Brick 2)
+ Escaped more things and made displays always in escaped form for
  certain character sequences. It should be impossible to type
  non-escaped forms. The following should be used:
  \0 for 0 (this probably won't work in strings, but in chars should)
  \t for tab (character 9)
  \n for newline (character 10)
  \r for carriage return (character 13)
  \" for double quote
  \\ for slash
+ Copy + paste on escaped character won't unescape them anymore.
+ Fixed error message for invalid lines in Robotic
+ Fixed inability to import text files from other directories.
+ Huge overhaul of the source (proper types for things, directions,
  equalities, conditions, chest items, and potions), if anything is
  suddenly broken now let me know.
+ Made scrolls/signs only display text (letters, numbers, etc) in the
  default char set. That should be enough for now.
+ Added mousewheel support for robot editor and robot box display.
+ Fixed inability to load MZMs from other directories in the editor.
+ Wrapped audio stuff in proper mutex, hopefully this fixes some issues
  (like crashing when changing mod_frequency a lot).
+ Long current directory paths no longer write out too much in the file
  loader (instead the last bit is shown with a ... prefixing the
  beginning)
+ Decided to be nice and make board_scan not crash. Don't use it. It's
  only there to make one legacy game work. If you use it I will
  personally scold you. And don't tell other people to use it (that
  means you CJA). Use copy block x y w h "$str" t instead. If you don't
  know what that means read the help file, it explains everything.
+ Removed ability to copy + paste after changing board dimensions of the
  source under any circumstances (alt + R, alt + Z, import world, import
  board)
+ Fixed appearance of ghosts in F10 menu.
+ Prevented char editor from counting moving the cursor as an undo step
  if nothing was actually drawn.
+ Made pressing escape on initial char selection/board selection/param
  selection for things cause it to cancel placing anything.
+ Made it impossible to set board width/height to 0 again (oops)
+ Made starting lives and starting health take effect immediately for
  the first alt + t
+ Added ability to play OGG from alt + l (but not the other mods, don't
  want to clutter that up)
+ Made it so if no note follows an embedded SAM in a play string it's
  played at native frequency.
+ Accidentally made loading worlds in the editor not change the current
  directory, fixed that.

November 20, 2005 - MZX 2.81

+ Fixed a bug where MZX world/save names > 12 chars could cause weird
  things to happen (like doors breaking)
+ Fixed problems with helpfile/charsets loading when loading MZX
  outside of the directory MZX is in. This should fix file associations
  on Windows as well.
+ Changed board selector so when board 0 is "(no board)" it doesn't
  actually refer to the title but to no board.
+ Made import world not overwrite the title string.
+ Fixed bug that causes crash when trying to flood fill an area with
  the color it already is in the SMZX char editor.
+ Redid audio engine. Everything is unified now, meaning that anything
  you can use as a mod you can use as a sam and vice-versa.
+ The new audio engine uses its own master resampler that has three
  interpolation modes - see config.txt for more information.
+ sam 0 filename will play a file at its native frequency (note that
  SAMs that have been converted from WAVs are set to be played at
  8363Hz).
+ Added support for OGG vorbis audio files.
+ Fixed bug causing SFX volume control in F2 menu to not work.
+ Removed limitation on number of SAMs that can be played
  simultaneously.
+ Fixed bug where the mouse got "stuck" in the black border edges of
  non 640x350 fullscreen resolutions.
+ Fixed issues with message boxes being part default palette part
  current palette, they now always use the current palette.
+ Added mod_position counter. What these actually set/return is
  dependant on the type of file loaded. Modules use the current row,
  OGGs use the current PCM sample.
+ Added mod_frequency counter. There are a few things to note here:
  Modules have a "nominal" frequency of 44.1KHz. Other data types
  have their own nominal frequency to prevent output from
  sounding differently depending on the audio_sample_rate in config.txt.
  For OGGs and WAVs the nominal frequency is the one the file is
  encoded at.
  Changing the frequency can cause a noticeable one time popping sound,
  so it might not be desirable to slide it. This is much more prominent
  with lowering the frequency than raising it.
  This value is capped so it can't reach below 16.
+ Changed alt + L to play back at natural frequency instead of 8363Hz.
+ Fixed bug causing sensor deletion while the player is on top to
  destroy the player.
+ Fixed bug causing imported boards to possibly crash after being
  tested.
+ Fixed bug causing save_game and save_world to not work if a file
  with the given name isn't already present.
+ Changed function counter matching removing restriction on number of
  digits for parameters. 10+ digit inputs should no longer fail (for
  instance, abs-123456789)
- Save files from 2.80 are not compatible due to several changes in
  the save format.
+ Made counter/string names internally variable length instead of a
  fixed 14 chars. There is now no longer a name length limitation.
+ Changed alt+8 for mod * to just * in the hotkey listing.
+ Fixed crash when referencing (by param) sprites > 256.
+ The string system has been redone. Strings are now dynamically
  sized and don't have an artificial maximum length. Writing to
  string.N will guarantee that the size of the string becomes at
  least N, while reading in this way will return 0 if out of bounds
  to maintain the illusion of null termination. Be careful when using
  this.
+ $str.length returns the length of string $str (this is faster than
  iterating through it to find when chars hit 0)
+ Vlayer is dynamically sized. The vlayer_width/vlayer_height counters
  still work as per usual, but the vlayer_size counter has been added
  to adjust the maximum size. The default is 32768.
+ Fixed bug not allowing things to move over goop.
+ Fixed bugs causing current directory to be changed when importing
  things from other directories.
+ Properly implemented support for volume "string"
+ Fixed a few commands not working when they should from the global
  robot (such as put to dir of player)
+ Fixed a bug where going to a label at the end of a robot would treat
  it as if it's the first of its name in a sequence of labels.
+ Fixed a bug involving moving the a block with the player not moving
  what was underneath the player.
+ New help file, thanks MUCHLY to Terryn for pulling off this enormous
  effort!

June 6, 2005 - MZX 2.80h

+ Fixed a bug which could cause crashes when quiting the game.
+ Fixed some bugs when changing boards and other things that can
  cause duplicate players.. I think.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when adding boards
+ Improved response time in editor for slower computers/high load
  situations
+ Fixed some endian issues with the GUI
+ Fixed some crash when moving the mouse cursor around in the editor
+ Fixed bug where you if you had a robot whose name is the same as
  the global robot it wouldn't get messages (fixes yoyo in Weirdness)
+ Fixed debug box not moving with text input
+ Fixed bug with duplicate player appearing when killed and a new one
  can't be put at 0, 0
+ Added copy/paste for outside of MZX to/from the robot editor. It
  only works in Windows and X11, and functionality may be limited in
  X11 right now (currently seems to work in native X11 apps and
  GTK 2.6 apps but not earlier GTK or QT, also try shift + insert to
  paste)
+ Fixed bug in resizing involving overlay blanking.
+ Fixed clear messages/projectiles not working (and damaging the game
  instead)
+ Fixed behavior of P key in editor for wildweasel.
+ Fixed random in Robotic not correctly swapping the range if they're
  given in the wrong order
+ Fixed clip length in [ messages
+ Fixed crash when changing volume without a game loaded
+ Redid internal GUI system, fixes some minor things
+ New file loading/saving window - press del to delete a file/dir,
  alt + n to create a new directory, alt + r to rename a file/dir.
+ Added PC speaker volume control to F2 settings and config.txt
+ Fixed yet another crash bug with resizing boards
+ Fixed inability to type * in text placement in the editor
  (although this adds inability to turn on mod * while F2 is on...)
+ Added ctrl + n in the editor to load a module for listening only
  (won't set the current board's module, and will let you choose
  ones from different directories)
+ Fixed crash on macros with more variables than can be displayed
  in their configuration.
+ Fixed bug that causes char selection cursor to reset to 0 on
  unhandled keys (and continuously do so for lock keys)
+ Tweaked ctrl + dir in text entry boxes.
+ Added gdm2s3m in-tree to the contrib/ directory. gdm2s3m no longer
  needs to be installed on the system before compiling mzx.
+ Improved the build system to automatically build .c and .cpp files
  with compound system CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, respectively.
+ Made package.sh automatically ship the source package with a
  Makefile.dist to warn the user that they need to run config.sh before
  'make'.
+ Rectified inconsistency in source copyrights.
+ Added multicharacter editor. Select multiple keys in the character
  selection with shift. The char editor also now has the ability to
  perform operations (delete, copy, scroll, etc) on subblocks. Hold
  down shift or press alt + b to highlight a region (press escape to
  remove the latter). Blocks copied like this will be pasted to where
  the cursor is at. Other small things in chareditor tweaked/changed...
  No longer press tab to toggle through set/clear/toggle draw modes,
  instead tab for set mode and shift + tab for clear (no more toggle).
  Mouse behavior is modified as well. In non-SMZX left click sets,
  right click clears. Shift + F2 will cut a block (clear + copy)

  alt + x/alt + i can now be used to import/export partial charsets
  while in the char editor. You can do so for several in series:
  put a # in the name of the charset then set the First for the
  first number # will be replaced with and the Count value to
  indicate how many in series to work with.
  For instance, saving s#.chr with first = 0, count = 3, starting
  at offset 100, with a 2x2 char selection will save charsets
  s0.chr from 100, s1.chr from 104, s2.chr from 108, and
  s3.chr from 112.

  *** NOTE *** Series import/export will only work correctly with
  char selections that are one in height (can still be split up
  another way in the editor itself). So if you want to use
  partial charsets on your edits it's important that you select
  all the chars in a row.

+ Made characters for the editor/GUI use another charset that's
  protected. Please notify me if any characters are incorrect.
  Modify mzx_edit.chr to change this charset.
+ The same thing goes for colors. It doesn't work for SMZX, which
  also might look a bit different in the editor...
+ Added option (defaults on) to protect chars 32-127 in input
  boxes and strings in the robot editor.
+ Mouse warping goes to middle instead of top corner now, so there
  isn't a biased towards moving up.
+ Hopefully fixed another bug with the cursor and changing boards...
+ Fixed module looping problem in modplug...
+ Added libmodplug 0.7 with both patches (see contrib/) in-tree.
  Removes system dependency on libmodplug.
+ Made auto-backup on by default (3 count)
+ Made if touching idle, beneath always false instead of like nodir
+ Fixed bug that caused bad things to happen if you pressed too many
  different keys too rapidly.
+ Made mouse wheel emulate up/down in dialog boxes and list menu.
+ Added ctrl + backspace to intake (delete previous word)
+ Made modulo operator use floored instead of truncated mod (uses
  positive remainder instead of negative)
+ Fixed crash when testing after using ctrl + z to clear a board.
+ Fixed bug where sending other robots to subroutines caused the
  return address to be to the next instruction like local subroutine
  calling works.
+ Fixed bug where going to a label on the last line of the robot could
  screw the game up.
+ Fixed a bug where the editor froze if you tried to fill the board with
  players (eheh...)
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when sending all sensors something.
+ Fixed some crashes when exporting/saving fails.
+ Fixed import world's ability to go over the board limit and cause
  crashes.
+ Allowed input of decimal numbers for params.

April 1, 2005 - MZX 2.80g

+ Fixed crash on alt + x in robot editor.
+ Fixed missing line on alt + h in robot editor.
+ Introduced incorrect enter action in robot editor (didn't reset to beginning
  of the line), fixed.
+ Fixed garbage appearing when moving from a larger to smaller board and being
  outside of that board's scroll region.
+ Fixed bug that could cause glitches/crashing when resizing the board
+ Fixed error with global next option not retaining the three checkmark
  options correctly.
+ Added work around so that move block moves the player (won't move it on
  inter-board moves)
+ Fixed bad palette loading for Linux introduced in 2.80e or f or something
+ Made it so block highlighting doesn't highlight the debug window.
+ Made the debug window move if necessary when home/end is pressed.
+ Added autorepeat buffering so previous keys can be resumed.
+ Fixed bug with swap world possibly not working (crashing??) off Windows
+ Fixed more problems with garbage/crashes when resizing with the cursor
  in a position causing the scroll to go off the edge
+ Fixed incorrect text cursor offset with force_height_multiplier on.
+ Redid way directories are loaded internally so you can load dirs with over
  4096 entries now. Might be faster (unsure)
+ Chest contents list menu looked funny, fixed.
+ Changed default.spl to smzx.pal so you can load it more sanely.
+ Export block wasn't getting the last selected line. Fixed.
+ Hacked scroll editor so it wouldn't crash when removing lines. Scroll code
  either needs to be 100% overhauled or replaced by robots somehow...
+ Fixed config files not being closed.
+ Added include file option for config files. Use it like this:
  include configfile  e.g. include subconfig.cnf will load subconfig.cnf's
  options
+ Fixed freadN not terminating strings.
+ Fixed graphical glitch when using the mouse in the char selector.
+ Fixed save games crashing when they can't load fopened files.
+ Fixed some other problems with save games and fopened files...
+ Accidentally had title screen running a bit slow...
+ Value strings starting with ( not parsed as an expression if they
  don't end with the )
+ Fixed problem with key_code being triggered for keys that aren't
  in-game
+ Removed the unimplemented if player dir and if not player dir
  commands from RASM
+ Added extended macros. This allows for parameter based macros to
  be entered in the robot editor via a window or by command. See
  macro.txt for more information.
+ Fixed player cloning after flip/mirror and player placing.
+ Added random seeding that was mysteriously missing...
+ Finally added drive changing for Windows builds.
+ Fixed mousex/mousey for resolutions other than 640x350 (only applies to
  fullscreen)
+ Fixed crash on weird invalid death/endgame boards...
+ % and & messages clip correctly now.
+ Fixed potential crash on double closing the files.
+ Fixed crash bugs with placing sensors and maybe scrolls.
+ Fixed sending sensors when you have robots of the same name (fixes
  Weirdness chapter 1)
+ Fixed bug that can screw up your world when placing scrolls or sensors..
  sometimes.

December 26, 2004 - MZX 2.80f

+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when auto-quoting params in the robot
  editor (eg, set x 1 -> set "x" to 1)
+ Fixed a bug that could crash the robot editor if you added a new line prior
  to the first line of a marked block, then did an action on it.
+ Fixed a bug where clearing the first and only line could cause it to appear
  as if it hadn't been cleared at all.
+ Unified global and global next parameter setting so that nothing is lost
  between first/next but information can be cancelled without application.
+ Fixed E/S block markers appearing in the robot editor when they should be
  off the screen.
+ Left click position in robot editor mysteriously disappeared after having
  been added somewhere after 2.80d. Readded.
+ Added option to hide the hotkeys help and horizontal border in the robot
  editor with alt + h. Also added a config.txt option to have it default
  this way.
+ Search/replace in the robot editor. ctrl + f to find or replace/replace all,
  ctrl + r to repeat either search or replace (depending the last one you did,
  if you cancelled this does nothing)
+ The load_game counter sequence was broken; fixed.
+ Hopefully fixed all means of overrunning the current line max length in the
  robot editor...
+ Fixed robot editor validation not showing every 13th line
+ Fixed aesthetic problem with validation report....
+ Fixed crash with setting message column less than 0.
+ A couple things added for 2.80e mysteriously disappeared in source handling.
  Readded.
+ Changed max board size prevention to auto resize the lower dimension to the
  max that can be handled with the higher (ex, 30000x25000 becomes 30000x559)
+ Added floodfill to char editors (alt + f)
+ Added single depth undo to char editors (alt + u)

December 19, 2004 - MZX 2.80e

+ Fixed a bug causing problems with static overlay if a non-overlaid sprite
  is displayed so it's clipped off the edge of the screen.
+ Fixed a bug in the display of c?x color boxes in the F2 menu in the robot
  editor
+ Fixed a bug that caused incorrect thisx/thisy for one cycle after copyblock
+ Fixed a bug preventing calls to nonexistant subroutines from passing that
  point in the robot
+ Fixed crash on sam 0 "file"
+ Fixed a bug where loading new SFX may not correctly overwrite previous ones
+ Fixed a bug where you could only load/unload so many mods before MZX couldn't
  load anymore.. same bug as the SAMs but went unnoticed!
+ Fixed a bug that caused you to be infinitely stuck in the global settings
  dialog box when you press previous on the next page.
+ Fixed a bug where going to next then exiting would not save the changes
  from the previous page.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes while ending modules.
+ Fixed a bug that could do the same kind of thing with sams.
+ Fixed an allocation bug when loading MZX worlds that could lead to crashes.
+ Fixed a bug that caused MZX to crash if you interpolated an expression with
  a value equal to or greater than 1 billion.
+ Fixed a bug where mixing ccheck1/2 with sprites from board and vlayer could
  cause problems (that's the short version of the explanation, I'll spare you
  the long one)
+ Fixed a bug that could cause certain old MZX games to crash after the title
  screen
+ Somewhere broke missiles between 2.80c and 2.80d. Fixed.
+ Fixed error in lit bomb anim sequence setup in char ID editor.
+ Reworked a lot of robot editor code; adding/deleting lines while marked areas
  are active should work more naturally now and it's hopefully no longer possible
  to crash it in the same ways it was previously.
+ Fixed crash when setting mesg row to less than 0.
+ Fixed mouse presses not working in the robot editor.
+ Made MZX ignore alt + tab so you can safely switch in your WM without it
  triggering...
+ Added numerical key entry for number boxes. Use 0-9 to add to the most
  significant digit and backspace to take it away.
- Fixed maximum board size to about 16.7 million tiles (128MB), for now.
+ Added config.txt option to make MZX pause when key focus is lost
  (when clicking on another window, perhaps) or when it's minimized. Music will
  still continue.
+ Added save/load position to the editor. Works for loads inbetween boards as
  well. Press ctrl + num to save to slots 0 through 9 and alt + num to load from
  that slot. Please press shift + 8 or the numpad * key instead of alt + 8 to
  set mod wildcard.
+ MZX now ignores the mouse scroll wheel instead of interpreting it as a click.
+ Fixed a further bug that could cause playing samples to crash.
+ Added config file option to revert the robot editor to the default palette
  when loaded.
+ Fixed bug in shoot command.
+ Fixed error when making save name in editor but cancelling.
+ Auto-backup - see config.txt for details.
+ Joystick key mapping - see config.txt for details.
+ You can now load game-specific config files by creating game.cnf for the
  corresponding game.cnf (for instance, caverns.cnf). This is mainly useful
  for joystick key mapping. Note that these settings will NOT go away if
  another game is loaded that doesn't have a .cnf.
+ Alt-enter finally works as block action in the robot editor.
+ Loading a .mzx/.sav from another directory indirectly (via command-line or
  robotic) will now actually change the current working directory.
+ Fixed bug that crashed MZX with ctrl + i in the robot editor.

October 9, 2004 - MZX 2.80d

+ Fixed cursor going invisible when escaping from import in the editor
+ Fixed robot editor entry when pressing OK on global info
+ Fixed lack of name for MZB import/export (any MZB's exported in prior
  beta versions still won't have a name)
+ Fixed some problems with setting the mouse position
+ Fixed problem with exits not bringing you all the way to the edge if width
  over 400 or height over 200
+ Fixed bug that cleared too much when increasing both width and height while
  resizing the board
+ Fixed problem with 1 char shortcut commands with spaces immediately after them
+ Fixed problems with load_robot and load_bc (caused crashes and infinite loops)
+ Optmized RASM heavily (this should be most noticable when doing a lot of
  external robot loading from text files)
+ Fixed inability to use absolute paths in loading a game from command line
+ Fixed lastshot/lasttouch conditions with directions not working
+ Fixed char editor in robots not going into SMZX mode when proper
+ Cleaned up source code so it passes -Wall without complaint and in the process
  corrected some glaring code errors that may have corrected random problems
+ File opening broken in 2.80c, fixed
+ Implemented MZM2 saving and loading and rewrote mzm.cpp (if anything is changed
  or fixed regarding MZMs, attribute it to this). MZM2s can be of larger
  dimensions, smaller filesize for same amount of data, and can store robots.
+ Fixed bug that could cause MZX to crash when making new strings
+ Block operations to overlay when overlay was off caused crashes - fixed
+ Fixed a problem with sprite ccheck2 against other sprites
+ Optimized function counter lookups a bit; speed gain for all counter accesses
  (especially ones that begin with certain characters such as _)
+ Fixed disassembly error with ' ' character
+ Fixed assembly error where condition extended dir (such as blocked opp seek)
  was not getting compiled with the dir extension
+ Fixed editor bug where the param was not being cleared when overwriting things
  by double placement
+ Fixed inability to use counters with playercolor/bulletcolor/missilecolor
+ Added ability to use counters in place of p?? in the robot editor
  Note - even though this expands functionality of the editor this does not
  require a version number change because the worlds will still be playable in
  older MZX versions (and will display correctly in the robot editor - you simply
  won't be able to correctly edit the commands)
+ Mouse correctly limited to screen edges now
+ Fixed inability to overwrite robots with pushable robots and vice-versa,
  as well as scrolls with signs and vice-versa
+ Possibly fixed problem with windowing error when editing global robot (?)
+ Fixed disappearing cursor after color selection box with mouse (and other places?)
+ Fixed bug in sprite clipping that caused some to be clipped off inappropriately
+ Made board_id/board_param counters readable
+ Added bound checks for all counters using board_x/board_y/overlay_x/overlay_y
+ Removed ability to put robots, scrolls/signs, and sensors (with the put command in
  Robotic)
+ Fixed potential direction corruption bug causing directions not to work
  sometimes even if they display correctly in the robot editor
+ Fixed copy overlay to MZM copying to overlay too
+ Fixed a bug where debug window could display the wrong amount of robot mem
  and potentially even crash MZX
+ Fixed help_menu counter not doing anything (durr)
+ Changed sprite draw order so they're drawn underneath the message bar,
  debug box, and time remaining display
+ Changed put p?? in Robotic so it will put default params if available
+ Fixed a bug that could cause copies from overlay to vlayer to not end up at
  the correct destination
+ Fixed a bug where c?x and cx? would not display correctly in the robot editor
+ Optimized copy blocks a bit using variable length arrays instead of malloc

August 16, 2004 - MZX 2.80c

+ Fixed issues with the commands counter not being reset
+ Color intensity now gets reset when you enter the editor
+ SAMs got cutoff sometimes now.. fixed
+ Fixed bug where loading a world with empty boards could change the starting,
  endgame, and death boards
+ Fixed bug where you could text enter off the bottom of the board, causing
  problems
+ Fixed bug involving cutting/clearing the entire robot in the robot editor
  while not at the first line
+ Fixed robot name entry for global robot not disappearing on small boards
+ Fixed bug where you could duplicate the player by holding down a direction
  as a saved game loads
+ Fixed bug where you could go to line 0 in the robot editor
+ Saving an MZM now auto-adds the .mzm extension...
+ Fixed black screen on quicksave
+ Fixed bug where opening a file didn't close the old one if one was open
  (so it'd eventually crash MZX)
+ Changed alt+backspace behavior in intake so it doesn't exit
+ Added clipping for refx/refy/width/height for sprites (less than 0 at
  initialization, greater than board width/height at draw)
+ Fixed direction parsing for move all
+ Fixed bug where creating things on top of the player would use a slot
  for  robots/scrolls/signs/sensors instead of just copy to the buffer
+ Added ability to use chars as immediates in Robotic commands
  (ie, set "$str.0" 'a')
+ Added options to enable oversampling and specify resampling mode in
  the config file (higher quality audio)
+ Building with patched modplug that fixes loading 2-channel mods
  outputted by FT2. If you're building yourself, see build.txt.
+ Fixed inability to mouse click in alt + h mode
+ Fixed ability to mouse click outside of board range
+ Should work better for Linux users; case insensitivity for file opens
  has been added.
+ Fixed close bug that was affecting Linux builds (may affect more)
+ Keypad enter works where normal enter works now
+ Fixed disappearing cursor when cancelling out of abandon changes box
  when loading a new world in the editor
+ Fixed problems when loading/saving robots outside of ID range (do not
  hardcode ID's people)
+ Fixed problem with NO BOARD exits being set to something else when
  empty boards were being stripped or when worlds were being imported
+ Fixed bug where auto-decrypting worlds didn't work if the XOR value
  was negative
