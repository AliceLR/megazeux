GIT

USERS

+ Board list typing now allows non-alphanumeric keys like spaces
  and periods. Typing a space first will match zero or more
  prefixed spaces while seeking.
+ Added the config setting "auto_decrypt_worlds". When set to 1,
  this allows MegaZeux to automatically attempt to decrypt
  protected worlds. For most platforms this option is disabled
  by default.
+ MegaZeux now silently ignores robots in older worlds with
  corrupt programs that are marked unused. This fixes an error
  message that would display when loading Wes.
+ Renamed "modplug_resample_mode" to "module_resample_mode".
  Fixed a bug where the xmp interpolation mode wouldn't be set
  correctly from this setting and instead would always reset to
  "linear". The default for this setting in config.txt has been
  corrected (the default has been "cubic" since 2.82b).
+ Fixed a ternary operator bug where the expression could break
  with certain counter names in the middle term.
+ Added a comment to the Emscripten frontend for how to disable
  the "Click to Play" splash.
+ Fixed Emscripten frontend issues when MegaZeux is embedded in
  an iframe making it difficult to regain focus after losing it.
+ Fixed an Emscripten frontend bug where certain filenames could
  cause false positives when checking for a directory name,
  preventing fsafetranslate from detecting the correct path.
  This fixes various things in Eternal Eclipse Taoyarin.
+ The Emscripten frontend should now fall back to memory storage
  if IndexedDB or local storage fails to initialize. This fixes
  an error when using MZX in a private browser window.
+ Fixed a robot editor regression where certain numpad symbols
  could not be typed.
+ Added "GL4ES wrapper" to the auto_glsl blacklist.
+ Added "Software Rasterizer" to the auto_glsl blacklist.
+ checkres no longer requires zip archive filenames to end with
  the .ZIP extension.
+ Added optional CSV output to checkres.
+ Added error to checkres for 1.xx worlds.
+ Fix checkres errors when encountering VER1TO2 empty robots.
+ ZIP support now ignores __MACOSX/, .DS_Store, and Thumbs.db.
+ Added decompression support for various legacy ZIP compression
  methods and deflate64.
+ The Emscripten frontend now falls back to a wrapper for MZX's
  internal ZIP support when UZIP fails to extract an archive.
+ Fixed IndexedDB support for legacy Edge versions. (asie)
+ Fixed an 8bpp software layer renderer bug where transparent UI
  colors would not be transparent in SMZX mode.
+ General software layer renderer (software, softscale, opengl1)
  performance improvements.
+ Fixed out-of-bounds CHAR_BYTE access with BYTE values over 14,
  added compatibility check for games relying on this. (asie)
- Removed the options "overlay1" and "overlay2" from the list of
  selectable renderer options except when SDL 1.2 is enabled.

DEVELOPERS

+ Refactored render_layer_code to use C++ templates.
+ render_layer now disables the (unused) 64-aligned renderers
  for 32-bit platforms and Emscripten builds.
+ Fixed buggy render_layer clipping that required clipping
  renderers to unconditionally use a suboptimal alignment.
+ Switched from xmp_load_module to xmp_load_module_from_file.
+ Fixed various clang unused argument compiler warnings.
+ Moved Makefile compiler version checks to arch/compat.inc.


September 23rd, 2019 - MZX 2.92b

This release fixes several bugs, notably 3DS and Wii rendering
issues and a bug where the wrong palette would be saved while
COLOR FADE OUT was active. Also in this release are performance
and usability improvements for the NDS and 3DS ports and a new
frontend for HTML5/Emscripten builds (special thanks to asie).

USERS

+ Fixed a bug where mouse warping both mouse coordinates would
  not actually warp both coordinates.
+ Fixed a port regression where save files would be saved with
  the wrong color intensities while COLOR FADE OUT was active
  (or during the first cycle of a board for <2.90 worlds). This
  fixes fading bugs in Ruin Diver 3.
+ Added compatibility for a bug where the robot message box
  would disable COLOR FADE OUT in versions 2.83 through 2.90X.
  This fixes several BKZX games.
+ Fixed checkres bugs separately preventing detection of global
  robots in both world formats.
+ Fixed 3DS renderer bug where the UI wouldn't properly display
  char foregrounds with extended graphics enabled.
+ Fixed 3DS renderer bug where sprites containing chars with
  transparent foregrounds wouldn't draw any char backgrounds.
+ Fixed 3DS renderer crashes that would occur when large numbers
  of sprites were active.
+ Improved file manager directory read times for 3DS/NDS/Wii.
+ File IO for world saving/loading is now buffered, which should
  improve save/load times on the 3DS and Switch.
+ Enabled writing zip data descriptors for the Switch.
+ Added classic/stretch video ratio support for the 3DS and NDS
  lower screens. (asie)
+ "classic" is now the default ratio for the 3DS, NDS, and Wii.
+ Fixed GX renderer bug where chars with both colors transparent
  could cause various graphical bugs in normal MZX mode.
+ Fixed bug where board exits could be cleared when deleting a
  board or after loading a world containing null boards.
+ Fixed bugs when playing STARDSTM.GDM with the libxmp engine.
+ Fixed a crash that could occur when importing a world in the
  editor containing a null board.
+ Fixed a bug where null boards wouldn't be properly refactored
  on the NDS while using a memory cart, causing entrances to
  point to the wrong boards and possibly other problems.
+ Fixed a bug that could corrupt the ends of robot programs when
  using an NDS memory cart.
+ Improved world loading times when using an NDS memory cart.
+ Improved NDS memory cart transfer speed. (asie)
+ Disabled NDS logging hacks when stdio redirect is enabled.
+ Exiting MZX on the NDS should now power off the NDS.
+ Added Emscripten frontend. (asie)
+ Fixed bug where errors in the title screen Load World window
  could clear the rest of the screen.
+ Fixed crash that could occur when attempting to load an
  invalid zip world.
+ Non-recursive directory deletion in the file manager now tries
  to delete the directory itself instead of its contents. Added
  error messages for failed file and directory deletes.

DEVELOPERS

+ Added initial support for the dirent d_type field to help
  avoid stat calls when reading directories.
+ Replaced most fseek calls in the legacy world loader.
+ Refactored move_current_board to be more readable.
+ Corrected some of the editor's bad extram handling and added
  warnings to debug builds to help debug it (no platforms at the
  present support both the editor and extram).
+ Replaced error wait_event() with update_event_status_delay().
+ Added preliminary VFS code to replace function pointer casting
  in zip.c.
+ Fixed Wayland/X11 detection for setups that don't allow X or
  Xorg to be run normally.
+ Unix builds should now attempt to load the icon from the
  installed path instead of from a hardcoded path. Builds with
  no sharedir set will use "contrib/icons/quantump.png" instead.


July 22nd, 2019 - MZX 2.92

Here's another inexcusably big minor version release. First off,
there are two new ports (Switch and Emscripten) and the Android
port has been updated to be actually usable. Second, joystick
support has been significantly overhauled (and depending on the
controller/joystick you plug in, it may work with no config
settings required!). Game joystick settings should no longer
override the new UI joystick behavior. Also, controllers can now
be used directly via Robotic. Read docs/joystick.html for more
information on the new features.

Other changes of note include RAD music support (v1 and v2),
palette editor improvements, and some new counters. There's a
new SDL 2 exclusive renderer to replace overlay1/overlay2 called
"softscale" that performs much better than either did and with
fewer crashes. Also of note are the massive number of fixed bugs
and compatibility improvements, fixing regressions and error
messages that affected around 20 different games (or more). A
major bug was fixed that caused the updater to not initialize
in Windows has been fixed too, so basically, update already.

FEATURES

+ Added numerous improvements to MZX's joystick handling:
  + Joystick inputs can now be bound to generic actions. These
    actions correspond to XInput buttons and can interact with
    MegaZeux's various windows in a context-specific manner.
    They can be used directly in Robotic with the new counter
    "joy#.[action]" or can be bound to keycodes in the config
    file to allow them to be used with older games. The NDS,
    3DS, Wii, PSP, and GP2X pad.config files have been updated
    to use actions. See the help file or config file for more
    info on the config options and available actions.
  + Added automatic joystick mapping for Windows/Mac/Linux/etc.
    Joysticks recognized as SDL game controllers are assigned
    joystick actions when detected. This behavior can be altered
    or disabled via config options.
  + New counter: "joy#active" will return 1 if a given joystick
    is availabled, 0 if not, and -1 if the index is invalid.
  + New counter: "joy_simulate_keys". When set to 1 (default),
    joysticks can produce simulated key presses, as in older MZX
    versions. When set to 0, this behavior is disabled.
  + Joystick settings in game.cnf files are now loaded as game-
    specific joystick bindings. These bindings will no longer
    override global/UI bindings defined by the config file or
    pad.config. The default bindings are restored when any world
    is loaded from the title screen; they are not restored when
    a save is loaded, between world swaps, or in the editor.
  + Joystick config options can be assigned to key names in the
    format of "key_X" (without quotes), where X is the key name.
  + Joystick config options for a particular controller now work
    with ranges of controllers e.g. "joy[1,16].lshoulder = 13".
  + Added the config setting "joy_axis_threshold". This setting
    allows the threshold for joystick axis mapped presses to be
    configured.
  + The NDS directional pad is now considered a joystick hat.
  + The 3DS directional pad is now considered a joystick hat.
    The circle pad is now mappable as axes 1 and 2.
  + The Wii Classic Controller triggers are now recognized as
    axes 7 and 8. The Guitar Hero axes have been shifted to 9,
    10, and 11, and a likely bug with the whammy bar axis has
    been fixed. The Gamecube controller triggers are recognized
    as axes 5 and 6, and all 8 controllers now have default
    bindings in pad.config.
+ Added/updated Android port. (asie)
+ Added Emscripten port. (asie)
+ Added Nintendo Switch port. (Lachesis, asie)
+ The main menu and game menu are now usable with keyboard,
  mouse, or joystick. Pressing a navigation key/joystick button
  or clicking an option in these menus will enable a cursor to
  select one of the options. Most listed options are selectable
  unless disabled by the current game, in which case they will
  be hidden from the menu entirely. However, the settings and
  exit options appear regardless of their respective counters.
+ MegaZeux now supports Reality Adlib Tracker (RAD) music files.
  Both 1.x and 2.x variants are fully supported.
+ New counter: TIME_MILLIS. Returns the milliseconds of the
  current system time.
+ New counters: MOD_LOOPSTART and MOD_LOOPEND. These counters
  return the start and end of the loop for the current playing
  music and can be set to change the loop while the music is
  playing. Setting MOD_LOOPEND to 0 disables the loop. These
  counters only work for Ogg Vorbis and WAV audio (not modules).
+ Added support for the LOOPEND tag for Ogg Vorbis files. This
  tag can be used to define the end of the loop directly, which
  may be more convenient for some users. This tag takes lower
  precedence than LOOPLENGTH if both are present, and will be
  ignored if its value is less than LOOPSTART.
+ The SPR#_OFF counter is now readable through Robotic.
+ New sprite counter: SPR#_Z. Sprites are displayed in order
  of their z value. Sprites with a higher z value will appear in
  front of sprites with a lower z value. This ordering takes
  precedence over both Y ordering (if SPR_YORDER is enabled) and
  sprite number. Removes the need to use SPR#_SWAP for managing
  sprite draw order. (Lancer-X)
+ New counters: FREAD_LENGTH and FWRITE_LENGTH. These counters
  return the length of the FREAD file/directory (if open) or the
  current length of the FWRITE file (if open).
+ New counter: SET "$string" "SAVE_ROBOT". This does the same
  thing as SET "filename" "SAVE_ROBOT", except it saves the
  robot to the specified string.
+ The default boot.dol for Wii builds with the editor enabled
  is now MegaZeux instead of MZXRun.
+ New GLSL scaling shader: "sai". This shader implements the
  "Scale 2xSaI" algorithm by Kreed with a modified interpolation
  function to produce sharper edges. This shader can scale up to
  any size larger than 640x350 and is comparable to hqscale
  (though it should look and perform a little better).
+ Fullscreen mode will now attempt to match a supported screen
  resolution if no "fullscreen_resolution" setting is specified.
  For scaling renderers, this favors the current desktop
  resolution. For "software", this favors smaller resolutions.
+ Added the config setting "fullscreen_windowed". When set to 1,
  MZX will create a borderless window with the current desktop
  resolution instead of regular fullscreen. Disabled by default.
+ Added the config setting "grab_mouse". When set to 1, MZX will
  trap the mouse cursor within the window while the window is
  active. Disabled by default.
+ The current renderer can now be set from the settings menu.
+ Added the 'softscale' renderer. This renderer is a generalized
  rewrite of the former SDL 2 overlay renderer implementation.
  It should perform significantly better and be more portable.
+ Added several palette editor usability improvements:
  + The current color stored with F2 is now displayed in the
    bottom-right corner of the palette editor help menu.
  + In SMZX mode 2 or 3 editing, the four colors of the current
    subpalette can be stored with F5. Stored subpalette colors
    can be placed at the current subpalette with F6. These are
    stored independently of the stored current color. The help
    menu color display will cycle through the stored colors.
  + In SMZX mode 3 editing, the current subpalette's indices can
    be stored with F7 and placed at the current subpalette with
    F8. The stored indices are displayed in the help menu next
    to the stored color display.
  + The shortcut for toggling the subpalette cursors has been
    changed to Insert. The subpalette cursors are now displayed
    in SMZX mode 3 editing and are enabled by default.
  + Palettes (and/or indices) can be imported into and exported
    from the palette editor with Alt+I and Alt+X, respectively.
  + Added a secondary editor-only palette which can be switched
    to with Tab. This palette is not saved with any world, but
    can be edited and imported to/exported from and can be used
    to copy colors/subpalettes between different sources.
+ checkres now displays the board, sfx, and robot (with line and
  position on the board) each file was referenced in.
+ checkres can now be used with a directory as the base file.
  Like a ZIP archive, checkres will recursively search the
  directory for .MZX/.MZB files and display information for all
  of them.
+ checkres has more display options: only display missing (-M)
  (default), only display created (-C), only display found (-F),
  also display missing (-m), also display created (-c), and also
  display found (-f).
+ checkres can now wildcard match resources from commands that
  use expressions or interpolation in filenames. This can be
  enabled with -w or enabled exclusively with -W.
+ checkres can now display unused resources in a path/zip after
  the other resources are listed (-u), or display only unused
  resources (-U).
+ checkres can now display every reference to a particular
  resource in a world instead of just the first with varying
  levels of information (-v, -vv). Added the option -s, which
  is the default and equivalent to older versions of checkres,
  and -1 as an alternate flag for -q.
+ checkres can now sort its output either by the name of the
  expected resource file (-N) (default) or by the location in
  the world the file was referenced (-L).
+ checkres option flags can now be combined (e.g. -aL). This
  does not apply to the "-extra" and "-in" flags.
+ New config options: "test_mode" and "test_mode_start_board".
  If "test_mode" is set to 1, MegaZeux will start the given file
  in testing mode, exactly as if the user used Alt+T on the
  first board from the editor. Setting "test_mode_start_board"
  to a valid board number in the world will start instead from
  that board. Exiting testing will exit MegaZeux entirely.
- SDL 2 support for the overlay renderers has been removed. When
  specified for video_output, softscale will be enabled instead.
- Removed WAV from the list of board mod extensions.

FIXES

+ SET "$string" TO "fwrite" will now always write the delimiter
  regardless of the length of $string. Previously, this command
  would only write a delimiter if $string was a length greater
  than zero, requiring extra checks by the user to account for
  this special case. Compatibility checks have been added for
  for worlds made in older versions.
+ Fixed bug where robots attempting to copy the player over
  themselves with COPY x y x y or COPY dir dir would get stuck
  in an infinite loop instead of executing the next command.
+ SPR_YORDER and the sprite collision list are properly saved
  and loaded from saves again.
+ The SPR_NUM counter now has the full range of a regular
  counter and is saved. Out-of-range values are ignored for the
  purposes of its legacy IF and PUT uses. This only affects
  2.92+ worlds. Additionally, 2.65 through 2.69c worlds treat
  its range as -128 through 127, fixing a bug in Sprite Catcher.
+ The active sprites count is properly updated when SPR#_OFF is
  set and is properly loaded from saves again. This value can be
  viewed from the variable debug screen now, though it may be
  inaccurate for older saves.
+ Fixed various bugs related to the robot position not being
  internally tracked correctly. This could be caused by WALK,
  SWITCH dir dir, OPEN, MOVE ALL, moving through a transport,
  pushing, and rotation. This fixes issues with IF ALIGNEDROBOT,
  THISX, THISY, THIS_COLOR, PLAYERDIST, HORIZPLD, VERTPLD, RID#,
  ROBOT_ID_#, the robot's coordinates displayed in the counter
  and robot debuggers, and MZM saving. Due to the number of
  features affected by these bugs, the fix only affects worlds
  saved in 2.92 or later.
+ Fixed a regression where rotating could sometimes fail to
  rotate the player, sensors, pushable robots, or transports.
+ When a robot uses the OPEN command and is pushed through a
  transport, MZX no longer crashes or creates invalid robots.
+ Fixed crash that could sometimes occur when pressing Alt+Up
  while drawing near the top of a board in the editor.
+ Fixed bug where canceling 'Alt+C' char selection in the
  robot editor would comment the current line.
+ Fixed a bug where F5 in the robot editor would not print data
  for extended chars.
+ Clicking through board name windows and other interfaces with
  the mouse should no longer place the current buffer.
+ Fixed a bug where the updater could fail to initialize due to
  a relative argv[0] in Windows. MegaZeux attempts to get the
  executable path from Win32 first now.
+ Improved warning message when no HTTP response is received.
+ The software renderer no longer tries to use an SDL_Renderer
  to draw the surface returned by SDL_GetWindowSurface. This
  fixes a crash when switching to fullscreen with the software
  renderer on some platforms.
+ Fixed a software renderer mouse crash bug caused by moving the
  cursor off the screen with a window bigger than the screen.
+ Fixed a bug where setting SMZX_MESSAGE to 0 wouldn't always
  draw the message correctly.
+ If a referenced SAM or GDM file isn't present, MegaZeux will
  attempt to load a corresponding WAV or S3M (respectively) with
  the same filename minus the extension. This should fix some
  music/sounds in older games that referenced SAM/GDM files but
  were packed with the post-conversion WAV/S3M files only.
+ The behavior for reseting the player movement repeat timers
  has been reverted to requiring all four movement keys released
  (as in 2.80 to 2.91i). The related player locking fix has not
  been modified.
+ IF "&$string&" and COPY BLOCK # # # # "&$string&" now properly
  resolve &$string& before checking if the first operand or the
  copy destination are a string (respectively), bringing their
  behavior more in line with SET/INC/DEC and other commands.
+ Fixed a regression where the COLOR INTENSITY commands would
  update the screen if used the same cycle as TELEPORT PLAYER.
  This fixes a graphical issue in Thanatos Insignia.
+ Improved string wildcard comparison performance.
+ Changed the debug window to display "2.65/2.68" for worlds
  from MZX 2.65 and MZX 2.68. Features from 2.68 still check for
  the intended MZX 2.68 magic; the very few existing 2.68 worlds
  that use these features need to be resaved in 2.69.
+ MegaZeux now attempts to fix Robotic that fails bytecode
  validation. This resolves error messages and bugs in Eternal
  Eclipse Taoyarin v1.0, Loco, Manuel the Manx, SaintZZT 7th,
  Slave Pit, and Ep+Arp World MZX.
+ The MOD SAM command has been restored for compatibility and
  is version locked to <2.80 worlds. This fixes missing sound
  effects in Crisis in Stuffyou City (original), Sprite Catcher,
  and Talon's Tale. This only works for libxmp builds.
+ Fixed a sprite collision bounding bug where the collision
  height bounding for the reference checked using the collision
  width instead. This fixes Manuel the Manx.
+ Fixed several memory leaks in the editor related to editing,
  placing, grab, and undo/redo operations on robots and scrolls.
+ Fixed vlayer memory leak when loading 2.84 saves.
+ Fixed a regression where the 'if c?? Sprite' legacy fix wasn't
  locked to 2.69c and up. This fixes Depravity (2003 DoZ #666).
+ PUT Sprite now works unconditionally for <2.80 games, fixing
  bugs where games relied on placing 0-height sprites or placing
  sprites before initializing their dimensions: Hackers Can Turn
  Your Computer Into a Bomb!, Lethal Recurse (2003 DoZ #215),
  Serum (2003 DoZ #404), Trashman Dan (Summer 2004 DoZ #18349).
+ The LOCAL and LOCAL# counters are now versioned separately,
  fixing bugs in Freedom Bound (Summer 2000 DoZ #4096) and
  Impact (2001 DoZ #027).
+ SHOOT now properly updates the blocked array. This fixes a bug
  in Captain Proton and the Reality Rippers (1999 WEoZ #173).
+ Fixed a bug where the custom SFX flag and max samples wouldn't
  be reset when creating a new world in the editor.

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed -Wunused-result warnings for Linux builds.
+ Added "Intel EMGD" to auto_glsl blacklist (questionable
  OpenGL 2.0 support).
+ Added platform-independent joystick event functions and
  updated the SDL, NDS, 3DS, and Wii event handlers for them.
+ MinGW builds now use -Wl,-Bstatic and -Wl,-Bdynamic to enforce
  the preferred linking when both static and dynamic builds of
  libraries are present.
+ For MSYS2 shells, config.sh now chooses the prefix /mingw32
  or /mingw64 by default if $MSYSTEM is "MINGW32" or "MINGW64"
  and either the "win32" or "win64" arch is selected.
+ MegaZeux now uses the renderer free_video function on exit.
+ GL_LoadLibrary no longer fails if the library is already
  loaded in SDL 1.2. (Lancer-X)
+ GL renderers free textures and revert to fixed function
  pipeline where appropriate. (Lancer-X)
+ OpenGL ES support can now be enabled for SDL builds with the
  --enable-gles option. This option is force-enabled for
  platforms that only support OpenGL ES.
+ opengl1 renderer now always uses power of 2 textures, same as
  opengl2 and glsl. This provides a tiny performance improvement
  on most cards and a massive performance improvement on some
  other cards. (Lancer-X)
+ Added debug build sanitizer options for AddressSanitizer,
  MemorySanitizer, and ThreadSanitizer. MemorySanitizer requires
  clang and all currently require Linux/BSD/Mac OS X/similar.
  Support for all three is very experimental; they may require
  disabling options like modular builds or may not work at all.
+ Moved several param functions from robot.c to run_robot.c.
  Aside from a few exceptions, these functions are largely used
  in run_robot.c only. This should improve Robotic performance
  in release builds.
+ Updated MSVC project for Visual Studio 2019. (elig, Spectere)
+ Added experimental pledge(2) and unveil(2) support for OpenBSD
  builds. By default, this is enabled for the utils but not for
  MZX. Additionally, config.sh now detects OpenBSD properly and
  several warnings have been fixed.
+ Fixed faulty '!' rule logic in match_function_counter and
  changed 'key?' to 'key!' to prevent potential false matches.
- Removed uthash as a build option.


February 20th, 2019 - MZX 2.91j

Here's a huge collection of bugfixes and a couple of features
that needed to be split off from 2.92.

Features: every release has an HTML copy of the help file now,
the editor keeps separate board/overlay/vlayer buffers now, and
anyone who still uses scrolls/sensors can view their info in the
counter debugger. The global volume settings use an exponential
curve now, range from 0 to 10, and have updated UI elements.

Fixes in this release include: the updater won't complain about
mzx_help.fil anymore, the NDS and 3DS ports have keyboards that
work again, several bugs that would lead to worlds/saves with
"Robot # does not exist on board #" errors have been fixed, and
several crashes have been fixed.

USERS

+ A complete HTML copy of the MegaZeux help file is now packaged
  with releases for all platforms. It can be found in the docs/
  folder.
+ Nvidia and AMD switchable graphics drivers should now detect
  MegaZeux and MZXRun properly on Windows.
+ The editor now remembers the contents of the buffer when
  switching between board, overlay, and vlayer editing. For
  example, if a robot is selected on the board before switching
  to overlay mode, the robot will still be in the buffer when
  the user switches back to board mode.
+ The editor now remembers the last filename for importing and
  exporting MZM, MZB, CHR, PAL, and PALIDX files.
+ Scrolls and sensors can now be viewed in the counter debugger.
  They can be found by expanding the Board list (when present).
+ Readded "#version 110" directives to all GLSL shaders, fixing
  warnings on some Intel HD drivers. OpenGL ES builds should now
  comment out these directives.
+ Fixed bug where using Modify+Grab on built-ins could clear the
  floor under the built-in.
+ Fixed bug where key repeat wouldn't work for any text field in
  the NDS/3DS/Wii ports. This also affected the robot editor in
  Wii builds.
+ Fixed NDS touch screen support. Touching the screen no longer
  acts like escape and the keyboard properly works again.
+ Fixed a bug where the NDS keyboard would drop keypresses on
  games not running at speed 2.
+ The counter debugger now correctly displays the value of
  local0.
+ Fixed a bug where the counter debugger would not reopen to
  the correct robot local# value.
+ MZX now attempts to retry removal of an old file when updating
  if deletion fails initially. Error messages related to the
  failed deletion of "mzx_help.fil" or "assets/help.fil" are now
  suppressed as they are caused by a bug in older MZX versions.
+ The help file is now closed before the updater restarts MZX.
+ Fixed crash bug that could occur when removing old files after
  an update.
+ Improved manifest validity checks.
+ Fixed board editor crash caused by invalid thing IDs.
+ Player movement key repeat no longer resets when the player is
  locked. It will reset for a direction only when the arrow key
  corresponding to that direction is released. This fixes a bug
  in Brotherhood where the player would move at a fraction of
  the speed they were supposed to while swimming.
+ Added version checking for legacy IF c?? Sprite behavior. In
  versions 2.82b and prior, c?? would make this command ignore
  the provided param and use SPR_NUM instead. This fixes Project
  MoveZig.
+ Fixed spelling error in missile param dialog.
+ Switching boards in the editor now properly translates the new
  board's mod name, fixing cases where board mods would restart
  sometimes.
+ Fixed a bug where the current board mod wouldn't play after
  starting a listening mod, testing, returning to the editor,
  and then disabling the listening mod.
+ Replaced the linear volume setting curve with an exponential
  curve to make lower volumes less loud. The volume settings can
  now be set from 0 to 10 instead of from 1 to 8.
+ The config file setting pc_speaker_on=0 no longer prevents
  turning on PC speaker SFX at runtime.
+ Added temporary workaround for numpad 5 key detection when
  numlock is disabled.
+ "Forest to floor" and "Collect bombs" are properly enabled
  again for new boards by default. This fix doesn't alter config
  settings or saved .editor.cnf defaults.
+ The "Downver. world (MZX)" option in the "Export as" dialog
  is now completely highlighted when selected. (Lancer-X)
+ Starting MegaZeux with "startup_editor=1" no longer loads the
  default palette over the startup world's palette.
+ The move block action and undo/redo operations should now
  preserve the element beneath the player.
+ Fixed crashes caused by using block actions or COPY BLOCK on
  the player while the player is standing on a sensor.
+ Fixed several bugs where editor block actions and the commands
  COPY/COPY BLOCK would not check for the player or clean up
  robots/scrolls/sensors. Worlds/saves saved after these bugs
  occured could display "Robot # does not exist on board"
  errors when loaded.
+ The DUPLICATE SELF x y and DUPLICATE SELF dir commands now
  properly check for the player before attempting to duplicate
  a robot. This fixes a bug where MZX could create saves with
  "Robot # does not exist on board" errors.
+ Fixed a crash that could occur when importing a new board.
+ Fixed a bug where the 3DS onscreen keyboard would send key
  releases instead of key presses.
+ The 3DS onscreen keyboard now returns shifted chars when shift
  is active.
+ Fixed a bug where the libxmp implementation of MOD_ORDER and
  JUMP MOD ORDER could not restart the current order.
+ Fixed a crash with the libxmp implementation of MOD_POSITION
  when providing an out-of-bounds value.
+ Fixed a bug where Ctrl+[key] shortcuts would not work while a
  dialog list element was active on the Wii.
+ Fixed a bug where setting the board mod/charset/palette could
  truncate the first letter of the path on the Wii.
+ "mask_midchars" no longer masks the non-text char 127.
+ The message box title and the command [ now properly display
  the graphic for char 9 instead of a tab.
+ Added newline escaping to robot, counter, and string names in
  the counter debugger to work around formatting bugs.

DEVELOPERS

+ Added the hlp2html utility, which can be used to convert
  WIPHelp.txt into web and printable HTML files.
+ Updated to latest NDS ARM7 template.
+ Updated SDL2 for Windows release builds to SDL 2.0.9.


December 9th, 2018 - MZX 2.91i

A small release with a bunch of fixes for bugs introduced mostly
within the past few versions. Other highlights: joysticks should
be hot pluggable now and Alt shortcuts now also work with the
command key in Mac builds.

USERS

+ MZX now properly detects when joysticks are connected and
  disconnected at runtime for platforms using SDL 2.
+ Fixed bug where the robot editor would open with the cursor at
  the end of the line instead of the start of the line.
+ Fixed a bug where the robot box could display using MZX mode
  but SMZX colors if opened on the first frame SMZX was enabled.
+ The built-in text box title should display correctly again in
  SMZX modes.
+ Fixed regression where keys could trigger wrong "keyN" labels.
+ Alt+F2 can now be used to open the settings dialog.
+ Mac users can now optionally use command in place of alt.
+ Improved editor cursor color selection for SMZX modes 2 and 3.

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed make test for SDL 1.2 builds.


November 14th, 2018 - MZX 2.91h

A minor release primarily focused on improving counter/string
lookups and fixing bugs in the robot editor and counter debug
menu.

USERS

+ auto_glsl correctly switches to glsl on startup now.
+ Fix bug where "(editor)" wouldn't always display in the
  caption when editing.
+ The single line macro dialog now allows the full size of the
  single line macros to be edited. This fixes a crash caused by
  having a macro configured to be longer than the edit box could
  display.
+ Setting a counter to a string no longer duplicates the entire
  string in memory.
+ Fixed faulty BOARD_X and BOARD_Y bounding for values greater
  than the board width or height. Fixes potential crashes with
  BOARD_CHAR, BOARD_COLOR, BOARD_ID, and BOARD_PARAM.
+ The value of SPR_YORDER is now correctly displayed in the
  counter debug menu.
+ Improved the performance of the counter debug search.
+ Fixed cosmetic counter debug menu issue where the the "String"
  tree appeared to be expandable/collapsable when empty.
+ Fixed faulty substring searching algorithm used in the counter
  debug menu search and for breakpoints.
+ Added "Search" and "Cancel" buttons to the counter debug menu
  search so it can be used with the mouse.
+ When testing from the editor, if "__test.mzx" exists MegaZeux
  will now choose a numbered name for this world backup (e.g.
  "__test2.mzx") instead of potentially overwriting work.
+ Fixed bug where six-digit line numbers would display in the
  robot editor incorrectly.
+ Inserting text in the robot editor using the F2/F3/F4/F5
  shortcuts can no longer exceed the line length limit, fixing
  related crashes.
+ Using F5 in the robot editor generates decimal numbers instead
  of hex numbers now.
+ Fixed robot editor bug where pressing delete at the end of a
  line wouldn't join lines unless the current line was empty.
+ Restored the ability to use the F7/F8 cheats outside of the
  editor. This feature was broken in 2.91g. To enable cheats
  outside of the editor, the config option "allow_cheats" must
  now be set to "mzxrun" or 1. The former will enable them for
  MZXRun only (same as from 2.82b to 2.91f) and the latter will
  enable them for both executables (same as the -þ flag in DOS
  versions).
+ Fixed bounding bug on the "board_default_width" and
  "board_default_height" config file options.
+ Separated robot editor "Search and Replace" dialog into a
  "Search" dialog and a "Replace" dialog. Both dialogs are
  smaller in size than the original. The order of the elements
  in these dialogs has also been altered to be more user-
  friendly. The hotkey for the new replace dialog is Ctrl+H.
+ Fixed Ctrl+R repeating for the "Replace All" robot editor
  search operation. Previously, it would act like "Replace".
+ Canceling the robot editor search/replace menus no longer
  disables the repeat feature.
+ Searching in the robot editor now properly preserves the case
  of the search string if case sensitive search is disabled.
+ Fixed bug where toggling the robot debugger position wouldn't
  take effect immediately.
+ Exiting the editor with the "startup_editor" config setting
  enabled should no longer inappropriately close MZX.
+ Selecting "tile" for the char editor import mode works again.
+ The bounds for the main editor charset import/export offsets
  and size have been increased to allow for extended charset
  values.
+ Fixed the "KEY?" labels for keys that no longer have a unicode
  representation in SDL2.
+ Fixed SET "$string" "FWRITE#" bug where, if # exceeded the
  length of $string, the output would be clipped to the wrong
  length.
+ The missile color ID char is now correctly set back to its
  default value when a new world is created from the editor.

DEVELOPERS

+ Cleaned up the counter debug menu code.
+ Switched from uthash to a modified version of khash for
  counter and string lookups. Counters/strings now consume less
  memory and counter/string lookups should perform slightly
  better on most platforms.
+ Replaced toupper/tolower in memcasecmp and substring searching
  with a lookup table-based implementation of tolower.
+ Refactored the following contexts to use the main loop: robot
  editor, intake, thing menu. For compatibility purposes the old
  intake still exists, but all robot editor hacks have been
  removed from it.


October 7th, 2018 - MZX 2.91g

This bugfix release fixes various minor-to-moderate bugs in
various areas of MegaZeux. The title/game update code has gone
through a fairly major overhaul and several parts of MegaZeux
have been combined to use the same loop. The conversion of
MegaZeux's interfaces to be compatible with this loop is an
ongoing process expected to occur over several versions.

USERS

+ Added "allow_screenshots" config file option. Setting this
  option to 0 will disable the built-in screenshot feature.
+ The F12 key can now be detected by Robotic.
+ Loading saves from the title screen no longer resets TIME.
+ Loading saves from the title screen no longer erroneously
  changes the player restart position.
+ Swapping worlds now sets the correct TIME and player restart
  position values.
+ Fixed a bug where the fade out effect from COLOR FADE OUT
  would be reset after any Robotic dialog.
+ Undo for overlay and vlayer mouse drawing now works properly.
+ Mouse drawing in the editor now draws smooth lines instead of
  lines with gaps.
+ Fixed move block bug when the source and destination both
  overlapped the player.
+ Palette editor component entry now accepts most of the same
  inputs as dialog number boxes.
+ The board name in the caption now updates to reflect the
  current board while testing.
+ Fixed bug where TIME would either decrement normally or not
  decrement at all while the slow time effect was active.
+ Added compatibility for pre-port endgame teleport behavior.
  In DOS versions of MZX, the endgame teleport would disable
  itself after being triggered for the first time and any
  following endgame would instead trigger a game over.
+ Reduced stutter in NDS and 3DS main screen scrolling.
+ Fixed a bug where creating a string MZM would not correctly
  set the string's length for preexisting strings.
+ Fixed a bug where loading robot source code from a string
  wouldn't work correctly with the robot debugger.
+ The help system is now accessible from the main menu and game
  menu.
+ The settings screen is now accessible from the main menu, game
  menu, editor, and palette editor.
+ The shortcut Ctrl+F2 can be used to open the settings screen
  from anywhere the settings screen is accessible. This shortcut
  works even if F2 is used for a different feature and will also
  ignore the value of the F2_MENU counter.
+ Fix a crash that would occur decrypting a world with a
  password exactly 15 chars long.
+ The label for the INPUT STRING command should no longer be
  able to overflow outside of the window.
+ Fix a crash that would occur attempting to open the help file
  from the world decryption confirm dialog.
+ Fix bug where saved layer MZMs and board MZMs without robots
  would have useless extra data at the end of the file.
+ Scroll contents properly display game colors during gameplay.
+ An error message is now displayed for failed board exports.
+ Enabled writing zip data descriptors on the 3DS to decrease
  saving time.
- The "password protected" error message has been removed as it
  was redundant with the confirmation dialog following it.
- The "disassemble_extras" and "disassemble_base" options no
  longer affect Robotic output during gameplay. SAVE_ROBOT will
  always output extra words and base 10 numbers regardless of
  user configuration.

DEVELOPERS

+ Implemented a main event loop to replace the various separate
  event loops scattered around MegaZeux. See core.h and core.c
  for more info.
+ Refactored the following contexts to use the main loop:
  titlescreen, gameplay, main menu, game menu, editor, palette
  editor.
+ When enabled, the debug FPS display will now update from any
  interface using the main loop. If fullscreen mode is active,
  the FPS display will now appear in the top-left corner of the
  screen for any main loop interface aside from the editor.
+ The --disable-screenshots config.sh option can be used to
  disable screenshot support. This allows platforms that don't
  use render_layer.c to stop building and linking it.
+ Cleaned up m_show()/m_hide() overuse.
+ Replaced all uses of "bool" with "boolean" to avoid potential
  C/C++ compatibility issues.
- Removed most old/unused source code in contrib/unzip, src/old,
  and src/vfs.


September 17th, 2018 - MZX 2.91f

A bugfix release focusing primarily on renderers, the 3DS and
Wii ports, and the Makefile build system. Highlights: the 3DS
port should perform better now, the Wii port's GX renderer has
been restored, the 'darwin' platform has more Unix-like options
now, and several crashes have been fixed.

USERS

+ The config setting 'audio_buffer' can also be specified with
  'audio_buffer_samples' now. The default value for this setting
  is now 1024 (instead of 4096).
+ Fixed a crash that could occur in the counter debugger.
+ Fixed a crash that occurs when attempting to add a watchpoint
  for robot local counters, loopcount, etc. Using these counters
  as watchpoints will watch the global robot's instances of
  these variables (for other robots, use e.g. r#.local1).
+ Using SMZX_INDICES or LOAD_ROBOT on an unset string no longer
  causes a crash.
+ png2smzx is now properly bundled with Linux builds.
+ Improved the performance of loading partial charsets for the
  glsl, opengl2, and 3DS renderers. Other renderers were not
  affected by this issue.
+ Fix opengl2 unbound sprite regression introduced in 2.91e.
+ The opengl2 renderer now correctly draws unbound sprites
  containing chars with a transparent foreground color.
+ 3DS renderer optimizations. (asie)
+ 3DS screen focusing now mimics the NDS port's behavior. (asie)
+ Fixed bug where games could fail to open files on some
  platforms if the paths contained duplicate slashes. (asie)
+ Added a Wii software layer renderer. This renderer can be
  selected with "video_output = xfb" in the config file.
+ Wii GX renderer optimizations.
+ Added layer rendering support to the GX renderer.
+ The Wii GX renderer now uses the gl_vsync config option to
  toggle vsync. For the Wii, this feature is on by default.
  Disabling it may increase the framerate of some games but may
  also cause other problems.
+ The loading bar on console platforms now redraws the screen
  less often.

DEVELOPERS

+ GAMESDIR/BINDIR/SHAREDIR now properly apply PREFIX when they
  are not explicitly set by config.sh.
+ LIBDIR is now user-definable like BINDIR et al. Variations
  such as "lib64" currently must be explicitly provided for
  platforms that still use them.
+ Remove src folder from CFLAGS to fix a bug where system
  includes could be mistaken for MegaZeux headers. All includes
  of MegaZeux headers must be done using relative paths now.
+ Fixed include bugs for X11 and Carbon clipboard handlers.
+ Makefile now attempts to respect the prefix when running
  sdl-config, sdl2-config, and libpng-config.
+ Renamed the "darwin" config.sh platform to "darwin-dist".
+ Added "darwin" and "darwin-devel" config.sh platforms. These
  act like Mac OS X versions of the "unix" and "unix-devel"
  options.
+ The darwin-dist build system and instructions are now somewhat
  more clear and robust.
+ Fixed a bug where zlib wouldn't necessarily be linked to
  png2smzx.
+ Renderers will now use render_layer to draw the text_video
  fallback if no render_graph function is present.


September 3rd, 2018 - MZX 2.91e

Bugfix release fixing some crashes, port bugs, and some other
significant issues affecting a variety of things.

USERS

+ Fixed bug where loading a board charset would also clear all
  of the extended charsets.
+ Fixed bug where loading a default charset in the editor would
  also clear all of the extended charsets.
+ Loading a 2.91 world when a renderer with no layer support is
  active no longer triggers an error message.
+ Fixed a memory corruption bug in the non-SDL Wii port caused
  by faulty threading code.
+ Fixed crash that could occur when updating a board undo frame.
+ Fixed crash when changing to a board with overlay disabled in
  overlay editing mode.
+ Fixed a bug where the protected charset could get cleared for
  renderers without layer rendering support.
+ Enabled C99-compliant stdio functions for mingw, fixing at
  least one crash bug and possibly improving performance.
+ The NDS port now attempts to detect argv[0].
+ The 3DS port now attempts to detect argv[0] and otherwise will
  start in /3ds/megazeux instead of /.
+ The 3DS port .3dsx file is now located in /3ds/megazeux.
+ The MOVE PLAYER [dir] and MOVE PLAYER [dir] [label] commands
  now update the commands cycle and commands total values.
+ Fixed a bug where MZX and checkres wouldn't accept some
  DEFLATE-related ZIP flags.
+ checkres no longer crashes on failing to open a resource zip.
+ The window caption now updates correctly when using either of
  the overlay renderers.
+ Update checking will now display an error instead of silently
  hiding the updater when the updater fails to initialize.
+ Fixed an issue where UIs would execute redundant frames.
+ Fixed a bug where string comparison would not order strings of
  different lengths correctly. (GreaseMonkey)

DEVELOPERS

+ Code style has been cleaned up in numerous files.
+ Moved GLSL shaders from assets/shaders/ to assets/glsl/.
+ Added missing GPL headers to GLSL shaders and added slightly
  better documentation to them.


July 12th, 2018 - MZX 2.91d

This is a minor bugfix release to get a handful of fixes out
primarily concerning the updater. The NDS/3DS/PSP/Wii ports now
include a copy of Caverns of Zeux.

USERS

+ Added timeouts to updater network operations.
+ Fixed bug where the updater would retry downloads without
  regard to the status code.
+ The updater is now force-disabled for all non-Windows
  platforms in config.sh.
+ Fixed bug where breakpoints could trigger on the wrong line.
+ Amended VOLUME/MOD FADE # # bounding to clamp values in port
  versions. DOS versions will still wrap between 0 and 255.
+ Added DOS compatibility fix for sprN_off.
+ Window caption is now properly updated when loading a world
  from an unedited world in the editor.
+ Fixed bug where ".." would change to the current directory if
  the current path ended in a path separator.
- Removed undocumented support for "title.cnf", "game.cnf", and
  "editor.cnf" config files, which would have been loaded from
  the same directory as the main config (not to be confused with
  world-specific config files, which are still supported).

DEVELOPERS

+ The MSYS2 buildscripts have been overhauled to work with the
  new devkitPro pacman repositories.
+ Added config options to select vorbis, tremor, tremor-lowmem,
  or to disable ogg vorbis file support. The 3DS and Wii ports
  now use tremor instead of tremor-lowmem.


March 4th, 2018 - MZX 2.91c

This release contains an assortment of bugfixes ranging from
player clone fixes to obscure compatibility patches. A handful
of updater issues have been fixed (or at least addressed).

MegaZeux can now automatically check for updates on startup on
Windows platforms. This behavior can be configured, and by
default will simply leave a message in the window caption.

USERS

+ MegaZeux can now automatically run the updater on startup
  on applicable platforms. This can be configured with the
  'update_auto_check' config file option.
+ Fixed a bug where several .MOD variants stopped working with
  libxmp enabled.
+ Sound effects in subdirectories can now be used in the SFX
  editor.
+ Fixed a bug where checkres would fail on legacy worlds with
  very long custom SFX.
+ Checkres no longer ignores the SFX tables of 2.90+ worlds.
+ Fixed a bug where interpolated expressions containing ternary
  operators could terminate counter names early.
+ Fixed faulty IF ANY compatibility behavior.
+ Fixed a bug where FWRITE functions could change the case of
  user-defined filenames when creating new files on non-Windows
  platforms.
+ SMZX mode 1 palettes are now exported correctly as 16 colors
  instead of as 256 colors.
+ Fixed subtly inconsistent timing in certain built-ins.
+ Fixed bug where wind and transporters could clone the player.
+ MegaZeux now restarts correctly in paths containing spaces
  when the updater is run.
+ Subroutines in pre-port MZX worlds now always return to the
  command after the subroutine was sent.
+ Typed color components now wrap from the maximum value to zero
  like dialog number inputs, and pressing minus will now negate
  the input number.
+ Copying chars in the char editor between regular and SMZX
  screen modes now works properly.
+ Fixed a crash that could occur when placing things on a vlayer
  larger than the current board.
+ Sharks and SpittingTigers with firing rates greater than 4 now
  retain their firing rate when edited.
+ Fixed a bug where world decryption could crash. (Revvy)
+ If the glsl renderer is selected by default, the detection of
  a software opengl driver will result in falling back to
  software. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug in the GLSL renderer where an additional window is
  created if the OpenGL version is low enough to cause a
  fallback to software. (Lancer-X)

DEVELOPERS

+ Added .MZX-based unit testing system. Run with "make test".
  See testworlds/README.md for more information.
+ The default renderer is now auto_glsl, which turns into glsl
  if not using a blacklisted opengl driver. (Lancer-X)


January 6, 2018 - MZX 2.91b

Here's a fairly significant update for MegaZeux 2.91, fixing
several major Robotic, audio, and editor related bugs, as well
as issues that mostly affected Linux platforms. Also of note is
the updated MSVC and Xcode support by Spectere.

USERS

+ Added the config file option "editor_thing_menu_places". When
  set to 0, selecting an object from the thing menus (F3-F10)
  will place the object in the buffer but not on the board.
  Defaults to 1.
+ Fixed a bug where MZMs could sometimes fail to load in the
  editor.
+ MZMs loaded in the editor now behave correctly when undone.
+ Fixed bug where GOOP_WALK wouldn't always be 0 when loading
  old worlds.
+ Values of GOOP_WALK greater than 1 no longer cause issues.
+ Board time limits greater than 255 are no longer truncated
  when saving worlds/saves.
+ Fixed bug where "robot not found" errors could result from
  using backspace on robots in the editor.
+ Fixed backwards string inequality evaluation.
+ String inequality compares are now endian-safe.
+ Fixed a bug where certain mods (e.g. FR_TOWER.MOD, Neve.s3m)
  could repeat to the wrong order after reaching the end.
+ Fixed a bug where certain .it channels could partially ignore
  the volume command.
+ Setting mod_position in libxmp now works for positions in the
  middle of orders (NoSuck).

DEVELOPERS

+ Updated MSVC for Visual Studio 2017. (Spectere)
+ Added xcode support. (Spectere)
+ "make clean" now deletes ccv. (pgimeno)
+ Fixed creeping CRLF usage. (Lachesis, pgimeno, Spectere)
+ Fixed a bug where the MSYS2 build scripts could inadvertently
  include non-portable SDL2 binaries in Windows builds.


November 22, 2017 - MZX 2.91

This release introduces mostly new editor features, but also a
a few Robotic features to note. It also fixes over 30 bugs.

MegaZeux now features a palette editor for SMZX modes 2 and 3,
and worlds can be saved and loaded in SMZX mode. The char editor
has been changed to allow preview palettes (mostly to aid with
SMZX editing), and can now access the extended character sets.
The new vlayer editor allows the vlayer to be edited directly.

On the Robotic side of things, LOAD_COUNTERS actually works now,
SMZX mode 3 indices can be loaded from a file, the message line
can be configured to use normal MZX mode in SMZX modes, and new
string features such as simple wildcard matching and negative
offsets have been added. String support has been improved to
disallow invalid or nonsense string splices that previously had
undefined behavior.

Additionally, asie's new Nintendo 3DS port has been merged into
MZX, and optional SDL support has been added for the Wii.

FEATURES

+ Added SMZX_INDICES special counter to load SMZX indices. This
  counter works with either a filename or a string, e.g.
  set "file.palidx" "SMZX_INDICES", and will do nothing outside
  of mode 3.
+ Added MOD_LENGTH counter. The value of this counter is length
  of the current playing music in rows for modules, or in
  samples for PCM audio.
+ Added MAX_SAMPLES counter. When set, MegaZeux will limit the
  maximum number of samples that will play simultaneously. Set
  to -1 to disable the sample limit.
+ Added 'max_simultaneous_samples' config file option. This
  behaves the same as the MAX_SAMPLES counter, but applies
  globally.
+ Added SMZX_MESSAGE counter. When set to 0 with SMZX active,
  messages will display in normal MZX mode instead of SMZX
  using the first 16 colors of the SMZX palette.
+ Added 'random_seed#' counters to read and write the random
  seed, 32 bits at a time (random_seed0 controls the low 32 bits
  and random_seed1 controls the high 32 bits. (Lancer-X)
+ Added a case-sensitive string equality operator:
  IF "$string" === "ABC" then "label".
+ Added wildcard-matching string equality operators:
  IF "$string" ?= "a?%" then "label"
  IF "$string" ?== "a?%" then "label" (case-sensitive).
  The character '?' will match exactly one of any character in
  $string, and '%' will match any number of any character in
  $string (including no characters).
+ Added negative indexing for strings, e.g. SET "$string.-X" 32.
  This manipulates the string at the Xth character starting from
  the end of the string (with -1 for the final character).
+ Added negative offsets for strings, e.g. SET "$string+-X" "a".
+ Added multiple character indexing for strings. When a length
  is provided with a string index, e.g. SET "$string.X#Y" 12345,
  the characters at positions X, X+1, ..., X+Y-1 will be treated
  as a single 8*Y bit number. This works for values of Y between
  1 and 4, with 4 characters providing the same functionality as
  a counter.
+ The palette editor and character editor are now accessible
  while testing. Press Alt+E or Alt+C respectively to access
  them from the counter debugger.
+ Extended the palette editor to SMZX modes 2 and 3. The updated
  palette editor allows the editing of all 256 SMZX mode 2/3
  colors and editing color indices for SMZX 3.
+ Component numbers can now be typed in the palette editor by
  clicking the component name or its number, e.g. clicking "Red"
  allows you to type a red value.
+ SMZX indices can now be imported/exported while editing in
  mode 3 using import/export palette.
+ Added a new vlayer editor. In the world editor, press Alt+V to
  switch to the vlayer editor. The vlayer is something like an
  invisible global overlay that can be used to store and
  retrieve graphical data through Robotic. See the editor help
  and the Robotic reference manual for more details.
+ Added color selection to the character editor. Press C to
  choose a color to preview and edit chars with, and press Alt+C
  to revert back to the default grey.
+ Added extended charset support to the char editor. Extended
  charsets can be selected during char selection. Note that in
  gameplay these chars can be accessed only by unbound sprites.
+ Selected blocks of chars with a height greater than one
  (before selecting a subdivision) are now properly supported.
  Using -/+ with these selections will move in a tiled manner,
  with no overlap between chars in "tiles". Charsets can also be
  exported/imported using this tiling behavior.
+ The -/+ keys now behave the same in the char selection screen
  as they do in the char editor.
+ The character editor help now covers several shortcuts that
  were previously missing (Alt+B, Shift+Arrows, etc...).
+ The undo/redo shortcuts in the character editor are now Ctrl+Z
  for undo and Ctrl+Y for redo.
+ Added undo/redo functionality to the world editor. Use Ctrl+Z
  to undo changes to the board/overlay/vlayer and Ctrl+Y to
  redo.
+ The default editor undo history stack size has been extended
  to 100 levels.
+ The editor will now prompt the user to create a new starting
  board when opened. If a new board is created, the global first
  board will be set to the new board and the title board will be
  renamed.
+ Saved positions now have confirmation dialogs. Saved positions
  are saved to/loaded from the editor.cnf file for each world.
+ Pressing Enter/Return on the overlay (and vlayer) now acts the
  same as on the board, changing both the buffer and the current
  layer being edited.
+ Pressing P on the overlay (and vlayer) now acts the same as on
  the board, changing the character in the buffer but NOT on the
  current layer. This is equivalent to the original overlay
  behavior for Enter.
+ Block tiling movement (Ctrl+Arrows) now works with most block
  actions, and does not require an initial block placement to
  activate.
+ Restoring its DOS functionality, Alt+D now toggles the default
  colors of built-in types in the editor. When disabled,
  built-ins placed from thing menus will use the buffer color
  instead of their default colors, and a red dot will appear on
  the right side of the status bar.
+ Color selection now supports typing in the hex value of a
  color/subpalette to select the given color/subpalette. For
  example, typing "4c" will select background color 4 and
  foreground color 12.
+ Readded the downver utility.
- Removed the undocumented Shift+F7 shortcut in the editor. This
  shortcut was redundant with F11.

FIXES

+ Fixed a bug that would cause Linux binaries to fail to find
  most resources.
+ Fixed a bug where loading a save from the titlescreen, exiting
  gameplay to a world that doesn't exist, and then loading a
  second save would corrupt the counter and string hash tables.
+ Fixed crash that would occur when loading a saved position on
  the same board referring to out-of-bounds coordinates.
+ Fixed a freeze that could occur opening the counter debugger
  to an empty list or searching for a counter in an empty list.
+ LOAD_COUNTERS now works as intended.
+ Fixed a bug where key repeat would be prematurely terminated
  when releasing a key while holding another key.
+ Attempting to open the robot validator with no errors will no
  longer crash MegaZeux.
+ Backspace now mirrors delete in overlay mode instead of
  affecting the board.
+ Moving an overlay block partially out of bounds in the editor
  will now correctly clear the block's original position.
+ The color selector will now correctly display SMZX palettes in
  SMZX mode instead of the default char 254.
+ Fixed bug where the mouse cursor would vanish after using the
  robot debugger configuration dialog in the editor.
+ Fixed a bug where the counter debugger could sometimes display
  behind the robot debugger after exiting the counter debugger.
+ Undo in the char editor now works correctly with the mouse.
+ The char editor no longer forces the screen to SMZX mode 1
  when editing in SMZX modes 2 or 3.
+ Fixed screen corruption bug when resizing the char editor in
  SMZX modes.
+ Fixed a bug where multichar editing wouldn't correctly wrap to
  the start of the charset.
+ The editing area outside of the current board is now correctly
  drawn when SMZX is enabled.
+ The viewport is now correctly drawn when SMZX is enabled and
  the UI or unbound sprites are active.
+ The editor bar no longer appears while SMZX is enabled in view
  mode.
+ Messages are now drawn correctly in SMZX mode.
+ Fixed bug where centering the viewport could change the width
  and height of the viewport.
+ Unbound sprites are now clipped correctly against the viewport
  when the viewport origin is not 0,0. (Lancer-X)
+ The VLAYER_SIZE counter now clears new vlayer area added when
  it is increased. This applies only to 2.91+ worlds.
+ The VLAYER_WIDTH and VLAYER_HEIGHT counters now preserve data
  on the vlayer when set. This applies only to 2.91+ worlds.
+ Fixed several bugs with string length and offset parsing that
  would allow invalid string accesses to work in certain cases.
+ COPY BLOCK $string now works correctly with string splices.
+ Fixed a bug where saving and loading 2.90X files wouldn't work
  on the Nintendo DS.
+ Fixed a bug where mouse clicks would carry through from the UI
  into games.
+ Invalid gl_scaling_shader values should no longer appear as
  the current loaded scaler.
+ MegaZeux now falls back to the default scaling shader when a
  selected scaling shader fails to compile.
+ Blank sprite chars are now drawn when ccheck is 3. (Lancer-X)
+ The sprite color is used with ccheck 3 collisions. (Lancer-X)
+ When spr_yorder is enabled, sprites with the same (sprN_y +
  sprN_cy) value are now consistently ordered by their sprite
  numbers.
+ The collision rectangles of ccheck 3 sprites now constrained
  to the sprite dimensions (Lancer-X).
+ MZX no longer crashes when a line of length 512 characters or
  longer is pasted into the robot editor.
+ Fixed a crash bug when trying to swap a sprite with an
  invalid sprite index.

DEVELOPERS

+ Added Nintendo 3DS port. (asiekierka)
+ Added "make uninstall" option to the Linux makefile.
+ Added devkitPro portlibs paths to the NDS and Wii Makefiles.
- Removed the depackers and non-MegaZeux formats from libxmp.


September 4, 2017 - MZX 2.90d

Here's another bugfix release. This is mostly assorted small
fixes, but there are also a couple of major fixes here: first,
the ternary operator now works correctly when nested both with
and without expressions, and second, sprN_setview does not break
in conjunction with certain unbound sprites. Additionally, SAMs
will not be converted to WAV files anymore (and are now natively
supported) and the robot debugger config is accessible from the
editor.

FEATURES

+ The current MegaZeux version is now visible from the enter
  menu on the title screen. This is to assist identifying the
  version on platforms that don't respect window title changes
  or have no window border.
+ Updated checkres.bat and checkres documentation.
+ The robot debugger configuration screen is now accessible from
  the editor via Alt+F11.
+ Removed SAM to WAV converter. MegaZeux now has native SAM
  support. (asiekierka)
+ Added crt-wave.frag, updated crt.frag. (astral)

FIXES

+ Fixed a bug where MegaZeux would crash when editing a robot
  with an invalid IF command operator.
+ Fixed a bug where the ternary operator would fail to find the
  correct colon when the middle term contained a second ternary
  operator in a nested expression.
+ Nested ternary operators should now behave as expected.
+ Fixed a bug where the built-in cursor would disappear after
  exiting testing with EXIT_GAME.
+ Fixed a bug where the listening mod would not restart after
  exiting testing.
+ Fixed a bug where the robot debugger would not wrap long lines
  of Robotic code correctly.
+ Attempting to save a world in a write-protected location
  correctly displays an error message again.
+ Fixed a bug where key repeat would not work when scrolling
  through the counter debugger tree list.
+ checkres will no longer report empty filenames as dependencies
  e.g. SET "" TO "FWRITE_OPEN".
+ The -q flag in checkres will now correctly output filenames
  instead of nothing.
+ Fixed a bug where sprN_setview would scroll the viewport to
  the wrong side of the screen if the sprite is unbound and is
  close to the top or left edge of the board. (Lancer-X)

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed PSP and NDS ports. (asiekierka)


July 25, 2017 - MZX 2.90c

This is a small fix release mostly cleaning up issues from the
previous release.

Notable fixes include a crash on certain instances of string
interpolation into counters/labels/text. Playing mods as sound
effects works again, and the audio_sample_rate config file
option now works correctly.

This release also includes support for loading save files from
MegaZeux 2.84X and experimental editor behavior for handling
board charsets and palettes.

FEATURES

+ Save files from 2.84X worlds can now be loaded.
+ The editor can be configured to automatically load board
  charsets and palettes now. Use the 'editor_load_board_assets'
  config file option to enable this behavior. This behavior is
  disabled by default. Note that this will OVERWRITE THE CURRENT
  WORLD CHARSET AND PALETTE and your changes will NOT be saved
  automatically.
+ GLSL is now the default renderer. (Lancer-X)

FIXES

+ Fixed bug where --disable-modular builds would fail to link.
+ Fixed bug with libxmp integration where mods could not be
  played as sound effects.
+ Fixed bug with libxmp integration where MZX would assume
  audio_sample_rate was 44100, causing mods to play at incorrect
  pitches with other rates.
+ Fixed bug where editor config file options would be ignored at
  the command line.
+ Fixed bug where string interpolation into a label/counter name
  could cause MZX to crash with very long strings.


July 16, 2017 - MZX 2.90b

It's been two weeks, so here's a bugfix release for MZX 2.90.
There isn't a whole lot that's new to talk about.

Firstly, the palette editor has gone through an overhaul. This
is mostly internal preparation for an eventual SMZX palette
editor, but the new features include the partial restoration of
mouse input (which was removed in 2.80X), the addition of color
sliders, the ability to hide the palette editor help, and two
new colorspaces (HSL and CIELAB) to aid in the selection of
palette colors.

Next, the robot debugger introduced in 2.90 has new features.
You can now set "watchpoints" to watch the status of particular
variables, and you can send labels/goto from the robot debugger.
The robot debugger config screen has been visually improved, and
line number breakpoints can be defined. Another notable feature
is that KEY_PRESSED and KEY_CODE values are now displayed in the
debug window during gameplay.

libxmp is now the default sound engine for modules, fixing a
longstanding bug where certain S3Ms would have muted channels.
GDM modules are now supported by MZX again. If you notice any
inaccuracies with mod files, please report them to the tracker.

Fixed bugs include a major overhaul of the glsl shaders for
compatibility with almost any system, various sprite, text box,
and input bugs, a crash fix when MZMs were saved from out of
bounds board locations, and a bug where opening worlds or
testing from the editor could cause MegaZeux to exit.

FEATURES

+ The "shaders/extra" folder is now "shaders/scalers". The
  default vertex shader is still located in the shaders folder.
+ The default scaling shader can now be set in the config file
  using the gl_scaling_shader option. If not defined, MegaZeux
  will load assets/shaders/scalers/semisoft.frag.
+ The robot debugger now supports monitoring the values of
  counters and strings. Use the config menu/breakpoint editor to
  add watchpoints; when the debugger detects a change in a
  watchpoint counter/string AFTER a command has been executed,
  the robot debugger will open.
+ The robot debugger can now send robots labels. Use 'G' or
  select 'Goto' in the robot debugger to use this feature. The
  name and label inputs support expression parsing and string/
  counter interpolation.
+ The robot debugger can now use line numbers in breakpoints.
+ The palette editor help can now be hidden with Alt+H. The
  default behavior for this can be set in the config file. The
  palette editor help is visible by default.
+ The palette editor's mouse functionality has been improved.
  Behavior when clicking the palette has been restored, and
  component sliders have been added.
+ The palette editor now supports alternate color spaces.
+ The debug window now displays the last key_code (green) and
  key_pressed (magenta) values detected during gameplay. These
  values are located in the bottom right corner of the window.
+ The default fullscreen resolution for scalable renderers is
  now 1280,720. The default fullscreen resolution for 'software'
  is still 640,480. The default aspect ratio is now 'modern'.
+ The checkres utility has been updated to support 2.90X worlds,
  worlds in subdirectories of zip archives, multiple input files
  to test, and the ability to specify secondary directories and
  zips to search (e.g. for games with separate music zips).

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed a bug where certain "keyN" labels, such as "key$", would
  not work correctly.
+ Integer comparisons between numbers greater than 2^31-1 apart
  now work correctly. (Lancer-X)
+ The palette editor now displays the SMZX mode 1 palette
  correctly.
+ Sprite collisions now correctly ignore the sprite's visual
  width and height.
+ Blank lines are no longer skipped when copy-pasting text into
  the robot editor. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where key presses in dialogs could be detected in
  games, and keypresses could still carry between other dialogs.
+ [ message boxes now use the same screen mode as everything
  else. Same with scrolls. (Lancer-X)
+ spr#_setview now works with unbound sprites. It's pretty nasty
  as the viewport can't scroll with pixel precision, but the new
  behavior should still be better than the old. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug affecting certain Intel HD Graphics cards and the
  GLSL renderer that appears to have been around since that
  renderer was first introduced. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where the numeric numpad keys were inappropriately
  translated to regular keys based on numlock when they were
  read from KEY_PRESSED. This behavior is now locked to worlds
  from 2.82X through 2.84X.
+ Fixed a bug where warping the mouse on one axis would snap the
  mouse to the nearest pixel on the other axis, causing problems
  for upscaled windows.
+ Fixed a bug where mouse control would not respect video_ratio
  settings aside from "stretch".
* Fixed a bug where MZX would attempt to load certain invalid
  worlds that should have been caught by validation.
+ Copy block to MZM no longer crashes when the MZM is partially
  overlapping the board edge. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed bug where MegaZeux would sometimes exit immediately on
  loading a game or would immediately exit testing.

DEVELOPERS

+ libxmp is now the default module sound engine. Use "make xmp"
  to make and install libxmp if it is not available on your
  platform.
+ Mac OS X portability improved. (Spectere and Why-Fi)


June 29, 2017 - MZX 2.90

Hey, it's been a while! Didn't mean to keep everyone waiting.
To make up for it as much as possible, we've prepared an extra
special release of MegaZeux here for you. Yeah, you!

I don't even know where to start with this release, as there's
simply a lot to talk about. MZX's world formats and rendering
architecture have gone through major overhauls, and a multitude
of bugs have been fixed (60+). Particularly the MZX UI graphical
glitch that occurred when an SMZX mode was enabled.

Some notable new features are unbound sprites (MZX's new native
pixel precision support), loading character sets/palettes/source
code/MZMs from strings, saving MZMs to strings, a new Robotic
debugger, the SAVE_COUNTERS and LOAD_COUNTERS function counters,
options to help create standalone game releases, the ability to
assign character sets/palettes to a board to load on entry, and
resetting boards on entry. The size limit of Robotic bytecode
has been increased to 2MB.

Other important mentions: MegaZeux has been updated to use
SDL 2.0 and libmodplug 0.8.9.0. The SAVE_WORLD function counter
has been permanently removed. The downver utility has been
temporarily discontinued, as adapting it to this release would
have been a considerable amount of work. Instead, there is a new
option in the Export menu in the editor to export a 2.84 world.

Enjoy, and try not to get overwhelmed by all of the new stuff!

FEATURES

+ Added a built-in robot debugger. See the Debug Mode section of
  the help file for details.
+ Added the COMMANDS_STOP special counter to MegaZeux. When a
  robot executes a number of commands exceeding this value while
  testing, the robot debugger will be enabled automatically and
  will open. During regular gameplay, it will be ignored. The
  default value of COMMANDS_STOP is 2000000.
+ The counter debugger now remembers its previous position after
  being reopened.
+ Added commands_cycle and commands_total variables to the Robot
  section of the counter debugger. See the Debug Mode section of
  the help file for details.
+ Certain types specified as 255 on the char ID table are now
  treated as Custom* types when placed and selected in the
  editor. If you switched a type to char ID 255 in a game that
  already had that type, the parameters will not be changed
  (and the types will still be char 0 if they were already
  placed in the world). When making a type a Custom* type from
  the global chars dialog, it will appear visually different in
  the list and in the character selection window, and also ask
  for confirmation.
+ The enter menu can be closed with escape now.
+ In the editor, the Backspace key now removes the top layer
  and brings the under layer to the top, as a compliment to Del.
  This does not affect the text entry behavior.
+ Seeking in the String section of the counter debugger will now
  ignore the $ prefix.
+ Tentative joypad POV hat support added: joyNhat = U, D, L, R
+ The BUTTONS counter has been extended to support the mouse
  wheel and X1/X2 buttons.
+ Strings can now be used in the LOAD PALETTE "file" command in
  place of a file name, i.e. LOAD PALETTE "$string+10".
+ Strings can now be used in the LOAD CHAR SET "file" command in
  place of a file name, i.e. LOAD CHAR SET "@240$chars".
+ Strings can now be used for the special counter LOAD_ROBOT in
  place of a file name, i.e. set "$str" "LOAD_ROBOT".
+ Strings can now be used for saving and loading MZMs in place
  of a file name, i.e. put "@$str" image_file... (Lancer-X)
+ Added ESCAPE_MENU counter. When set to 0, this counter will
  prevent pressing escape from opening the exit gameplay menu.
  This will not affect any other escape menus in MZX, and the
  exit gameplay menu can still be opened by other means, such as
  ALT+F4, CTRL+C, the window close button, etc.
+ Added EXIT_GAME function counter. When set to anything but 0,
  this will cause MegaZeux to exit to the title screen. This has
  no effect on the title screen.
+ Added the ternary operator (?:) to expressions. If the value
  to the left of ? is not equal to zero, the expression between
  the ? and the : will be evaluated. If the value to the left of
  ? is equal to zero, the expression to the right of : will be
  evaluated.
+ Added SAVE_COUNTERS and LOAD_COUNTERS special counters. These
  will save and load files containing every counter and string
  from the world they're used in, respectively. These files are
  not version checked, and may be used like save files.
+ Robots now keep their robot IDs after reloading saves.
+ Added standalone mode. The config parameters standalone_mode
  and no_titlescreen can now be used (from MZXRun only) to
  create standalone versions of MZX with the ability to fully
  customise the player's experience. See config.txt for details.
  (Lancer-X)
+ The minimal help bar now displays robot memory and the current
  board mod when contextually appropriate.
+ The minimal help options for the board and robot editors are
  now enabled by default.
+ Shaders can now be changed from the F2 menu when using the
  GLSL renderer. The user can select a fragment shader from the
  assets/shaders/extra/ directory. If a matching vertex shader
  exists, it will be loaded alongside the fragment shader.
  Otherwise, MZX will fall back to the default vertex shader.
+ On Linux and Mac OS X the configuration file will be copied
  into the user's home directory and given the name
  .megazeux-config if it is not already present. This config
  file will then be used instead of the global one. (Lancer-X)
+ Added unbound sprites. Sprites can be unbound from the grid by
  setting spr#_unbound to 1. Their coordinates will now refer to
  the sprite's location in pixels, not tiles. spr#_width,
  height, refx and refy still refer to chars; however, spr#_x,
  y, cx, cy, cwidth and cheight are all in pixels. Unbound
  sprites do not work with all renderers; currently, out of the
  renderers available on the PC platforms, the overlay2 renderer
  lacks this functionality. (Lancer-X)
+ Unbound sprites do not let char 32 or blank characters (when
  in ccheck 2) through like regular sprites do. Instead, set
  spr#_tcol to a color that will be transparent when the unbound
  sprite is drawn. (Lancer-X)
+ Unbound sprites can make use of additional hidden charsets.
  There are an additional 14 charsets beyond the default that
  can be modified through using load char set or char edit.
  (e.g. load char set "@256charset.chr")
  A sprite can be set to refer to these later chars with the
  spr#_offset counter. The offset value is then added to each
  char in the sprite. You can use this to refer to higher char
  sets.
  (e.g. set "spr0_offset" 256)
  Offset values can also be set to locations within a char set.
  (Lancer-X)
+ To allow you to access the extended charsets, the @ option to
  load char set now takes up to 4 digits, rather than merely 3.
  The + option still only allows 2 hex digits. (Lancer-X)
+ The colors used by tiles of a given color # in SMZX mode 3
  can now be rebound using the "smzx_idx#,#" counters.
  (e.g. set "smzx_idx7,0" 32)
  Now if you put down a c07 tile, all 00 pixels will refer to
  color 32 (as opposed to color 0 in SMZX mode 2 or color 7 in
  SMZX mode 1). These values are reset whenever the SMZX mode is
  changed. Once again, this is only available to renderers that
  support unbound sprites. (Lancer-X)
+ Edited worlds now retain their world version until resaved.
  Before, they would lose their world version after testing.
+ Added world version display to the debug window.
+ Added GOOP_WALK counter for robots.
+ Added "Reset board on entry" parameter for boards. When set,
  the board will reset to its original state when the board is
  entered during gameplay. This setting can be saved as a board
  default.
+ Added "Load charset on entry" parameter for boards. When set,
  MegaZeux will load the selected charset file when the board
  is entered during gameplay. This setting can be saved as a
  board default.
+ Added "Load palette on entry" parameter for boards. When set,
  MegaZeux will load the selected palette file when the board
  is entered during gameplay. This setting can be saved as a
  board default.
+ Maximum robot size has been increased from 64kb to 2mb.
  (Lancer-X)

+ Debytecode: the LOAD_SOURCE_FILE special counter can now be
  used to load and compile a robot program from source code.
  This can be used with either a file or a string as input.
+ Debytecode: the robot editor's import robot menu now supports
  loading legacy source code.

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed crash bug when using ALT+Z (Clear Board).
+ Fixed crash bug when attempting to view the help file in the
  updater.
+ Fixed crash bug when attempting to use SMZX_R/G/B with out-of-
  range indexes.
+ Fixed crash on exit when the config file did not explicitly
  specify update hosts.
+ Fixed memory leak involving bounds-breaking FREADn calls.
+ Fixed counter debugger issue where counters and strings
  starting with chars over 'Z' would cause everything in their
  section to be placed into the '#' list.
+ Dialog window labels can not be put into focus by clicking
  them with the mouse anymore.
+ Dialog windows closed by pressing escape will now close only
  on a new press instead of whenever the key is held.
+ Load (F4)/quickload (F10) on invalid save files in-game leaves
  the current game running instead of exiting to the titlescreen
  or editor.
+ Fixed issue where counter debugger would display wrong values
  for the robot LOCAL counters.
+ Fixed robot editor issue where global robot coords would be
  reloaded as 65535.
+ Fixed issue where board defaults would be reset after leaving
  testing until the world was manually reloaded.
+ Fixed issue where the Board Info dialog would not close when
  'Cancel' was selected.
+ Fixed bug where chars 254 and 255 would not be reverted back
  to their defaults via F4/F5.
+ Fixed bug where player would move onto goop when walking into
  enemys on top of goop.
+ Fixed bug where 'enter' would be detected in loaded save files
  when loading from a title screen.
+ Fixed issue where MZX was using the world file version instead
  of the internal MZX version when saving MZMs and determining
  whether it could load MZMs both within the editor and in game.
+ Changed the caption behavior in the world editor as to refresh
  only when board values are synchronized.
+ Fixed bug where, when exiting gameplay, the world would keep
  running on the title screen if MegaZeux lost read access to
  the world file.
+ Fixed minor bug where trying to load a nonexistant mod would
  change MOD_NAME's output while the previous mod still played.
+ Fixed a Windows-only bug, where attempting to load a Robotic
  file in the Robot Editor or with LOAD_ROBOT would not load the
  entire file if the file contained 0x1A (char 26).
+ Fixed a bug where the lazer animation would fail to complete.
+ Fixed bug where the VOLUME # and MOD FADE # # inputs could go
  out of range, resulting in ear-piercing white noise. Inputs
  now wrap between 0 and 255 for compatibility reasons.
+ Fixed bug where certain unicode values could crash MZX in the
  character selection dialog.
+ Fixed bug where : "keyN" would not work on the Pandora.
+ Fixed a bug where FREAD could create a string larger than the
  maximum string size.
+ In the sprite section of the counter debugger, the spr_clistN
  values were incorrectly labelled as "spr_collisionN". Fixed.
+ Fixed counter debugger crash when selecting certain strings
  containing escaped values.
+ Added compatibility for the cycle-ending SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE,
  SHOOTSEEKER, and SPITFIRE commands from MegaZeux 2.83.
+ Fixed crash bug when attempting to use file counters with
  paths equal to or longer than 512 chars in length. MegaZeux
  will now ignore such paths.
+ Fixed bug where MZX would crash with out-of-bounds joystick
  key mappings.
+ Fixed a bug where robots could not push the SliderNS type to
  the south.
+ Fixed a bug where a robot using #return or #top multiple times
  within a single command could cause a crash.
+ Fixed a port regression where IF ANY would continue to iterate
  over the board after finding a match, potentially triggering
  multiple subroutines, #return, or #top labels.
+ Fixed a bug where MZM error messages could repeat indefinitely
  and lock up MZX.
+ Fixed a bug where the (#)PUSHED label would not be sent to the
  first object in a row of pushed objects if that object was a
  robot.
+ Fixed support for PPC Linux builds. (Insidious)
+ Fixed a bug where a robot sent a subroutine would restart the
  command it was executing upon #return if the command was a
  multi-cycle command. This fix applies to worlds saved in 2.90
  and later only.
+ Fixed a bug where ALT+F4 would cause menus to open instead of/
  in addition to triggering an exit event.
+ Fixed a bug where subdirectory mods with different types of
  slashes in their names would fail to be recognized as the same
  mod.
+ Fixed a bug where SMZX palette intensities were not saved.
+ Made the opengl2 and glsl renderers endian-correct. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where keystrokes were getting lost during event
  processing. (Lancer-X)
+ The UI now uses the regular MZX mode and the protected palette
  when playing SMZX games. This is only available to renderers
  that support unbound sprites. (Lancer-X)
+ Changing from SMZX mode 1 to 0 correctly restores the palette.
  (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where the tree list in the counter debugger would
  rapidly scroll through elements when clicked.
+ Fixed a bug where the updater, on failing to receive data from
  the server, would consume large amounts of CPU before timing
  out. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed various bugs related to the pushing of sensors.
  (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where MZX would crash in some cases when testing
  after adding/importing new boards into a world.
+ Made KEY a board counter <=2.70. Also added masking <=2.62 to
  make Oath Demo work again. (Lancer-X)
+ Bullet types shot by robots clamped to 0-2. (Lancer-X)
+ SAVE_GAME and SAVE_WORLD now happen at the end of a cycle, not
  immediately. (Lancer-X)
+ SAVE_WORLD no longer exists. (Lancer-X)
+ Labels at the end of a program no longer get randomly sorted
  first and stop the actual first instance of that label being
  called. This fixes a bug in the Dark Corner 'Zane' demo.
  (Lancer-X)
+ Copy and copy block in pre-port MZX games now preserves the
  state of any robots copied. (Lancer-X)
+ Copying and pasting robot code with LF line endings on Windows
  now works. (Lancer-X)
+ MegaZeux can now be exited during an infinite loop. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where SAVE_GAME on the first cycle of a board
  would cause the game to be faded out on load. This still
  affects legacy worlds. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where trying to create new counters called "fread"
  or "fread_counter" in the counter debugger would cause the
  file being read to advance.
+ Fixed a bug where the numpad was unable to be used to control
  the player, despite being identical to the cursor keys for
  every other situation. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where pre-port worlds could play any number of
  concurrent samples. This makes portions of Bernard the Bard
  quite cacophonous. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where per-game config files could set options they
  weren't supposed to be able to.

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed linking bug when attempting to make a modular build of
  MegaZeux in Debian/armhf. -fPIC is now enabled for modular
  builds on all platforms. (Insidious, ajs)
+ Added SDL 2.0 support. At the moment, the overlay renderers
  are not accelerated by SDL 2.0 and may be slower than their
  SDL 1.2 counterparts. Other minor inconsistencies may exist
  between the two versions. (ajs)
+ Keycode help diagram replaced with an HTML file (from the
  older PNG file). This will make future updates much easier.
+ Updated NDS, Wii and PSP ports to latest devkitpro toolchains.
+ Updated libmodplug to version 0.8.9.0. (asiekierka)
+ Added experimental libxmp support. (asiekierka)
+ Added experimental libopenmpt support. (asiekierka)
+ New rendering architecture that mostly sits alongside the old
  rendering architecture. There is a new function implemented by
  supporting renderers: render_layer(). This provides a layer
  in a similar form to the text_video array in graphics and
  expects that to be drawn on the screen. This is called once
  for each layer that is drawn- this means the board, overlay,
  UI and sprites. Each layer can have a different SMZX mode,
  although at the moment this is only used to allow the UI to
  remain in regular MZX mode while the game or editor is in SMZX
  mode. The render_layer() function is only called if it is
  implemented by the renderer and if there is something on the
  screen that can only be drawn by the renderer (e.g. unbound
  sprites, or UI elements in an SMZX game) (Lancer-X)
+ LibSDL2 support is now the default. It can still be disabled
  by passing --disable-libsdl2 to config.sh. (Lancer-X)


December 24, 2012 - MZX 2.84c

Hey all, new version of MegaZeux here! And hopefully without any
crashes this time around!  Haha yeah right.

The most notable thing this release (besides fixed crash bugs,
as usual) is the new counter debugger! Give it a try and tell us
what you think!

Counter binary search has been replaced with a hash table in
versions of MegaZeux for most platforms. This has resulted in
slightly faster counter lookups, and MUCH faster creation of
counters, since MegaZeux doesn't have to keep the list ordered.
The hash table is turned off for NDS builds for now due to tight
memory constraints.

Otherwise, most of the new features are editor enhancements and
modifications. Notable mentions are reordering the board list
with 'M' and a custom undo history size.

FEATURES

+ The functionality of the F11 counter/string debugger has been
  expanded to include sprites, robots, and miscellaneous world
  and board variables. The ability to modify many of these vars
  is limited and a large portion are read-only. In addition, you
  may add new counters and strings, hide empty counters/strings
  (does not affect built-in variables), and search by name and
  contents. Export is still limited to counters and strings.
+ Max string length has been increased from 1MiB (1048576 bytes)
  to 4MiB (4194304 bytes).
+ Board mods may now be selected from subdirectories of the game
  folder in the ALT+N dialog.
+ The title bar now displays the world and editing board/robot
  names based on context.
+ Fire Burns Space and Fire Burns Forever are off by default.
+ You may now specify the size of the undo history in the char
  editor, and the history affects the entire char set. Undo is
  still ALT+U, redo is now ALT+R.
+ You may now use the -/+ keys in the world editor to move to
  the previous/next boards in the board list, and Shift+Arrows
  to change to the boards linked by board edge.
+ You may now move the current board anywhere in the board list
  with M. You may not move the title screen board.
+ View mode in the board editor (V) will start from the current
  location of the screen now rather than at the top-left corner.
+ Config file options for default board settings added, as well
  as the ability to save these per-world from the editor.
+ Ctrl+G - Goto board position at X,Y.
+ png2smzx now requires less arguments and has an option to skip
  a char (generally char 32 will be useful to skip).

+ Debytecode: The robotic editor now asks for a confirmation to
  save the program on exit.

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed a bug in the 'glsl' renderer that caused the cursor
  color to be ignored (always white). This caused the cursor to
  not be visible if shown on a white background. (ajs)
+ Setting $string.length will not cause memory corruption now.
  In addition, its pre-2.84 behavior of intentionally allocating
  the string past the set length has been restored, but the
  length itself will still be set to the correct value.
+ Added bounds check to INC "$string" "value". Attempts to
  increase a string past its maximum length (4 MiB, or 4194304
  bytes) will now fail.
+ Fixed MegaZeux crash that could sometimes occur when a string
  was increased by itself.
+ Fixed MegaZeux crash that could occur when exiting the editor
  to a world file that failed validation.
+ Rolled string->storage_space into string->name to prevent
  buffer overflow errors and crashes. (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed crash that would occur when attempting to type in a dir
  in the ALT+N dialog.
+ Fixed a bug where copy block $string would apply REL twice.
+ Thanatos Insignia (DoZ Q1 2011, 98485) will now play without
  freezing both normally AND after loading a save. Robots will
  not be incorrectly versioned with the save format magic now.
+ Fixed bug where ALT+M wouldn't always edit non-stored types.
+ Fixed bug where ! could not be used as a substitute for ~.
+ Fixed a bug where tab-draw and block actions would carry
  between board and overlay editing. ALT+O now sets the drawing
  mode back to normal on a switch.
+ ALT+M now edits the overlay instead of the board while editing
  the overlay.
+ Quick-load (F10 during gameplay) will not work if the load
  menu (F4) has been disabled with the LOAD_MENU counter.
+ Fixed a bug where the listening mod directory would stay the
  same as the directory the editor was opened in.
+ The listening mod now continues to play after world and board
  changes, and also after the board mod has been changed by
  ALT+N or Shift+8/*.
+ LOAD_GAME will not incorrectly trigger JUSTENTERED anymore.
+ Palette/intensity changes made on the same cycle as a teleport
  player command are now properly taken into account. This fixes
  a game-stopping regression in Sponkgo's Legendary Journey
  where leaving the second stage's bonus area would leave the
  color intensity at 0.
+ SMZX mode is now disabled when leaving the editor if it was
  enabled in the editor via F11.
+ Fixed potential crash bug where robot bytecode files were not
  being validated before being loaded with LOAD_BC.
+ Fixed minor message box bug dating back to DOS where a message
  box starting with an unavailable option would begin with the
  cursor on a blank line.
+ Fixed crash that happened when typing over bounds while
  renaming a file in a file manager dialog. File and directory
  renaming now use a popup dialog akin to ALT+N.
+ Files with names longer than 55 chars may now be selected in
  file managers. The limit for typing in a file name is still 55
  chars.  You may not enter a blank line as a file name anymore.
+ Fixed segfault when attempting to read THIS_COLOR for the
  global robot. It will now always return -1.

DEVELOPERS

+ Overhauled txt2hlp. Error messages now differentiate between
  hyperlinks and labels and will take the display chars ~ and &
  into account. Eventually, the goal should be to get rid of
  txt2hlp altogether and have MZX load straight from the .txt
  file.
+ Added compile option to use uthash for counter/string lookups
  as opposed to binary search. Ideally, this will vastly improve
  lookup speeds for large numbers of counters/strings, but will
  consume more memory. (thanks to Lancer-X for the modified
  uthash header file)


June 20, 2012 - MZX 2.84b

Less than three weeks after the last one, MegaZeux 2.84b is here a few weeks
early to fix a key regression regarding the use of REL commands with the
COPY x y dx dy command.  While several new features have been added, this
release was mostly about rooting out as many crash bugs from MegaZeux as
possible.  An official public beta release of debytecode has been pushed off
once again due to time constraints.

Most notable as far as new features go, pressing 'E' while a game's  title
screen is running will now take you directly to that world in the editor. A
blank new world may still be created with 'F8', and now with the 'N' key. The
function key corresponding to the new 'E' functionality is 'F9'.

A major new aspect of this version, which could be seen as a bugfix or as a
new feature, is MegaZeux's ability to validate the MZX, MZB, MZM, and SAV file
formats. Validation has been rigorously tested and refined, and a comprehensive
list of most world files that fail any check is available on the MZX Wiki. File
load crashes and force-quit "Out of memory" errors in these instances are nearly
a thing of the past.

One final major change regards the file manager dialogs (Load Save Game, etc).
These dialogs have been internally overhauled to avoid permanent directory
changes unless a valid world or save file has been loaded.  If any bugs are
experienced using these, they should be reported to the MZX Bug Tracker.

FEATURES

+ Pressing 'E' or 'F9' on a title screen will now open the current world for
  editing.  Press 'N' or 'F8' to create a new world.
+ Multiple hosts may now be defined in config.txt. Update attempts will
  be carried out in the order they are defined.
+ A startup path may be defined in config.txt ("startup_path").
+ Specifying the backup filename with a directory, ex. "backup/file", will now
  silently attempt to create the directory if it does not exist.
+ MZM3 is now forward compatible (robots will be dummied out).

BUGFIXES

+ World validation has been strengthened, preventing disasterous loads of most
  non-world files.  Mostly intact/valid worlds, such as HUNTDRAK.MZX, can be
  loaded -- corrupt/missing boards will be replaced with blank boards, corrupt
  robots will be replaced by robots with empty programs, and so on.  If more
  robots/scrolls/signs are found on a board than their data suggests there
  should be, the extras will be replaced with customblocks. Back up the version
  of the world with errors in this instance, as the robots' code or scroll text
  may still be salvageable from the world data.
+ Fixed a long-standing memory corruption bug in the shoot command introduced
  by the port.
+ Mac OS X: MegaZeux now uses /Users/[username] as the default starting
  directory. Apps previously would always start at the filesystem root. (ajs)
+ Fixed dangerous crash-causing bug where the editor would not chdir back
  to the correct directory after testing.
+ MegaZeux, after saving a world to a new directory, now chdirs to the new
  current world file's directory.
+ Changed behavior where a failed save file load would fade the still-running
  world out of focus. MegaZeux now leaves the world in focus.
+ All failed world/save loads leave the current world running and in the same
  working directory.
+ When startup_file is defined as a directory at the command line, MZX chdirs
  to the directory instead of attempting to open it as a world file.  In the
  config file, the directory is pruned off since there's a new config option
  for the startup path.
+ Fixed regression where the rel commands would be ignored for board to board
  copy x y dx dy.
+ Updated MZX_SPEED in the counter debugger, where it was still getting clamped
  from 1 to 9.
+ COLOR FADE IN and COLOR FADE OUT (and all built-in uses of them) now correctly
  respect any COLOR INTENSITY changes made before they are used.
+ In file selection dialogs, when attempting to make a directory that already
  exists with ALT+N, MZX now shows the correct file name and does not force the
  user to quit MegaZeux.
+ In file selection dialogs, when pressing ALT+D with a directory selected, MZX
  now correctly prompts to delete the selected directory instead of a file.
+ The option to import world files in the board editor now correctly takes the
  world version into account.
+ Savegame MZMs loaded into the editor now have their robots dummied out for
  safety purposes.
+ Fixed bug where INPUT STRING would not terminate lines longer than 71 chars
  after clipping them.
+ INPUT STRING and ASK do not allow either tabs (INPUT only) or line breaks
  (both) anymore.
+ Fixed bug where putting a scroll/sign in the editor buffer and then selecting
  something else could cause a crash on leaving the editor.

+ Temporary fix for MSVC bug where all window dialogs would freeze. (MZXGiant)
+ Temporary fix: board block actions will not corrupt robot source code in DBC
  anymore. (MZXGiant)

DEVELOPERS

+ Switched debian prereq. and darwin libpng12 to libpng, switched darwin and
  default ldflags to use '--ldflags' instead of '--libs'.
+ Darwin CC/CXX compiler can now be specified on the command line. (ajs)
+ Cleaned up broken ifeq structure in darwin Makefile.in so ARCHes other than
  i686 can be built.
+ Updated MSVC dirent.h to the latest version (MZXGiant)
+ Added updated MSVC dependencies. (MZXGiant)



June 1, 2012 - MZX 2.84

The first version of MegaZeux to be released in two and a half years, this
time with a vast number of bugfixes, several new features, and hopefully
no new bugs.

There's a new port to the Pandora platform from Exophase. There are no
binaries for this platform yet, as ajs has not had time to set up the
cross-compiler. Same goes for Android.

Another major (internal) change this time around is that Exophase's
experimental "debytecode" language modification has been merged. This still
has some major bugs open against it, and missing features, so we won't be
doing official releases yet. You can add support for this feature by
passing "--enable-debytecode" to config.sh on all platforms.

Thanks to Terryn, Exophase and MZXGiant for their contributions and to
Lancer-X, Old-Sckool and Lachesis who reported and tracked the majority
of bugs this time round.

FEATURES

+ Added experimental port to Pandora. See arch/pandora/README for more
  information. (Exophase)
+ Directories may now be opened with FREAD_OPEN.  This functionality
  can be used in conjunction with FREAD_POS and set "$str" FREAD.
  FREAD will set the string to "" when it has reached the end of the
  file listing.
+ MZX_SPEED can now be set up to 16 by a robot or from the F2 dialog
  menu. (Lachesis)
+ Numbers can now be temporarily backspaced past their minimum value
  to make typing a new number more intuitive in dialogs. (Lachesis)
+ Chars 0 and 255 can now be selected from the Edit Chars submenu of
  the Global Info menu. Using char 255 on a kind that would have
  previously denied it now gives a warning dialog. (Lachesis)
+ New Counter: SPACELOCK represents the default space functionality for
  the built-in player. Setting this counter to 0 disables it, allowing
  the player to move as normal when space is pressed. Setting it back
  to 1 enables it again. Defaults to 1. (Lachesis)
+ New Counter: FREAD_DELIMITER allows you to change the terminating
  char for the string FREAD function.  The terminating char still
  defaults to '*'. A complementary FWRITE_DELIMITER function has been
  added as well. (Lachesis)
+ New Counter: ARCTANdy,dx takes two values and returns the angle
  with corrected quadrants as an alternative to using ATANdy with
  DIVIDER as dx, which was less intuitive and never documented
  properly. (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: MINv1,v2 and MAXv1,v2 return the minimum or maximum
  value between two inputs, respectively. Chain several of these in
  an expression or a loop for more arguments. (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: bchX,Y; bcoX,Y; bidX,Y; and bprX,Y are new shorthand
  access counters for BOARD_CHAR, BOARD_COLOR, BOARD_ID, and
  BOARD_PARAM.  The same limitations to those counters apply to the
  new ones. (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: uchX,Y; ucoX,Y; uidX,Y; and uprX,Y are new shorthand
  access counters for the board's under layer.  The same limitations
  apply to these as to their board counterparts.  Additionally, these
  counters will fail if the same spot on the normal board is occupied
  by a floor-type (space, [dir]water, lava, fake, etc...). (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: ochX,Y and ocoX,Y are new shorthand access counters
  for the overlay.  Like OVERLAY_CHAR and OVERLAY_COLOR, these are
  read-only to discourage the user from writing to these instead of
  using the much faster put [color] [char] overlay [x] [y]. (Lachesis)
+ Pressing ALT+G from the world editor now goes directly to the Global
  Robot without having to skip through the Global Info menu. (Lachesis)
+ MZM3 has been enabled for 2.84 and all following versions.  The
  difference between MZM3 and MZM2 is that MZM3 stores a copy of the
  world version, allowing the robot format to change. (Lachesis)
+ COPY can now take + and # prefixes to its arguments. COPY BLOCK and
  COPY OVERLAY BLOCK can now take + prefixes to their first set of
  coordinates. (Lachesis)
+ Subroutine versions of TOUCH, BOMBED, INVINCO, PUSHED, PLAYERSHOT,
  NEUTRALSHOT, ENEMYSHOT, SHOT, PLAYERHIT, LAZER, SPITFIRE, GOOPTOUCHED,
  PLAYERHURT, KEY[char], KEYENTER, THUD, and EDGE have been added. These
  should ALWAYS be used in conjunction with LOCKSELF/ZAP and #RETURN or
  #TOP to keep the robot stack under control.  Please remember that THUD
  and EDGE ignore LOCKSELF and their subroutine versions must be ZAPped.
  JUSTENTERED, JUSTLOADED, and the sensor labels have been excluded from
  this due to various reasons. (Lachesis)

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed a bug where LOAD_ROBOT or LOAD_BC would not reset the stack
  pointer for newly loaded programs. This could cause crashes if a robot
  popped the stack in the new program.
+ Fixed a bug where range checking of BOARD_X and BOARD_Y would sometimes
  not be done correctly, leading to crashes.
+ Strings in the debug menu list no longer interpret any color codes they
  may contain.
+ Fixed a bug where a string would not be interpreted correctly if it
  used a '.' character in a splice parameter expression. Expressions such
  as IF "$str#('$str2.length'-4)" = "blah" THEN "label" will now work
  correctly.
+ Fixed negative sprN_cheight et al from crashing. (Exophase)
+ Placement of objects on the player will be blocked with an error dialog
  like DOS versions, instead of silently failing after setup. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed a bug where LOAD_ROBOT would not properly parse lines of imported
  code that had leading whitespace. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed an integer wrapping bug in debytecode, disallowed numeric literals
  outside of the bounds of a signed short. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed a bug that would corrupt the UI palette if "set color" was run
  against a color index over 15. (MZXGiant)
+ If either board dimension is less than the editor viewport, the character
  and colors used to indicate space outside of the board are taken from
  protected sets. In game, they are taken from the game's sets.
+ Increase limit on difference for RANDOM "A" TO "B" to UINT_MAX rather
  than INT_MAX - 1 as it was previously. Since the entire range represented
  by a counter is now usable, there are no cases where RANDOM will "break".
+ Fix avalanche rings and potions to limit boulder placement to 1/18,
  matching the AVALANCHE command.
+ Fix corruption and possible crashes when using VIEWPORT SIZE to set the
  viewport to a size less than 80x25 but greater than the current board
  dimensions. The viewport will now always be clamped to board size.
+ Fix incorrectly changing horizontal mouse position on setting MOUSEY.
  (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed overflow into protected character set when "Revert to..." is
  selected in the character editing dialog. (MZXGiant)
+ Music and SFX now mute when the updater launches and are restored when
  it is complete. (MZXGiant)
+ Fix odd string behaviour when copying between strings that happen to
  be stored close to each other in memory. This fixes a regression
  introduced by the "crash when pasting to and from the same string"
  fix in 2.82b.
+ The size/offset parameters for strings can now be specified in either
  order (#+ vs +#) and will behave correctly.
+ Revert bogus cycle-ending behaviour for SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE,
  SHOOTSEEKER and SPITFIRE.
+ Improve cycle-ending compatibility with MZX versions prior to 2.80.
  Fixes games such as Kya's Sword and Stones & Roks II.
+ Restored shark's ability to move in goop.
+ Clear SPR_YORDER upon loading a new world.
+ When transitioning between boards, compare the module filenames of the
  source and destination boards case-insensitively. A difference in case
  will no longer cause the board module to be incorrectly restarted.
+ Fixed rare rendering corruption in the load game dialog.
+ Fixed a bug where SEND "robot" TO "#return" could corrupt the program
  counter of the target robot if it had a stack pointer of zero.
+ Fixed some security issues with SMZX_PALETTE and LOAD_BC counters.
+ Only list/open regular files or symlinks to regular files in file
  dialogs. Special files are now ignored.
+ Opening directories with FWRITE_OPEN is now rejected properly on all
  platforms.
+ Fixed a bug where a file would be re-opened for read/write, even if
  the file was missing or an I/O error occurred before saving.
+ Fixed a bug where MZX could occasionally crash due to label list
  corruption when copying robots from heap locations greater than
  2^32 bytes apart (only affected 64bit builds).
+ Stopped SET "var" <command> from assembling. Some invalid uses of
  command tokens were already being ignored, but this was just luck.
+ Sprites with color c?? (inherited "natural" colors) will correctly
  inherit the colors of special characters such as the player and other
  self-colored built-ins.
+ Debytecode's legacy expression converter should use is_string()
  instead of its own (buggy) hand-rolled version. Fixes crash when
  converting CoAZ.
+ The editor no longer incorrectly clamps the intelligence of sharks,
  spitting tigers and spiders to <=4, and no longer clamps the HP of
  dragons to <=4. (Lancer-X)
+ Accept SET EDGE COLOR "string" in addition to SET EDGE COLOR c??.
+ Fixed NDS port initialization on DSi devices. (asiekierka)
+ Fixed a bug in the joystick code where centering an axis clears
  the previous axis button. (iamgreaser)
+ Fixed a bug that allowed vlayer->board COPY BLOCK to overwrite
  player. Blocks that would overwrite the player are now ignored.
+ Fixed a 2.81e regression that allowed SENDs to self to ignore
  LOCKSELF.
+ Setting $str.length now makes $str the length specified. (Lachesis)
+ Caps Lock no longer interferes with dialog box text input. (Lachesis)
+ Increasing the size of a string with $str.length, $str.N, or with
  a splice now wipes old string data with char 32s.
+ Dialogs (especially "Exit gameplay - Are you sure?") now require the
  user to have actually hit ESC to close, making escaping busyloops
  and message loops much easier. (Lachesis)
+ Added a compatibility fix for different label caching in 2.80 through
  2.83 that allowed constructs such as : "LABEL" / SEND "ALL" "LABEL"
  on an unlocked robot to continue instead of getting caught in a loop.
  The altered label caching caused #98485 Thanatos Insignia to lock up
  in an unescapable busyloop in GIT versions. (Lachesis)
+ MOD "[lead-in file]*" now works properly. In previous versions of the
  port, this construct would result in the lead-in file failing to play
  and the wildcard mod restarting when the player re-entered and re-
  exited the board. (Lachesis)
+ Fixed a bug where mod "*" would cause the mod to restart when entering
  another board with the same playing mod. (Lachesis)
+ ALT+D (Default palette) now requires a confirmation. (Lachesis)
+ The COMMANDS counter is now saved as a 32-bit variable. (Lachesis)
+ The LOOPCOUNT counter has been moved to save-only data and is now
  saved as a 32-bit variable. (Lachesis)
+ Fixed a bug where not all whirlpools were being considered as such,
  notably during the transport board scan. (Lachesis)
+ The abilities of PLAY "&file&" to play at multiple frequencies and
  to parse multiple files have been restored. (Lachesis)
+ As of MZX 2.84, BOARD_COLOR will now ignore the under color of any
  object with a BG color of 0 that is on top of something.  Worlds that
  relied on this between 2.80 and 2.83 are unaffected. (Lachesis)
+ Setting BIMESG to 0 will now disable Game Over's auto-centering of the
  message row. (Lachesis)
+ The DIVIDER counter's documentation has been updated to explain its
  true purpose.
+ Fixed an editor bug where canceling a world load could cause MZX to
  forget the filename of the current world. (Lachesis)
+ Pressing ALT+M in the world editor now edits anything with parameters,
  not just Robots, Signs/Scrolls, and Sensors.

DEVELOPERS

+ Source tarballs are now generated in XZ (LZMA2) format.
+ Make hlp2txt utility work correctly on Windows platforms.
+ Updated and repaired MSVC project for Visual Studio 2010. (MZXGiant)
+ Win32 binaries are built ASLR-capable (via pefix).
+ Version control was changed from SVN to Git; the repo is at:
  http://github.com/ajs1984/megazeux
+ The EGL backend now supports Mesa's EGL implementation on X11.
+ Imported libmodplug 0.8.8.4 and rebased all patches.
+ Introduced SOCKS4/4a/5 support transparently into the network layer.

December 29, 2009 - MZX 2.83

It's been a year since the last release, due in part to my reduced free
time, and less contribution from other developers in 2009. I'd also like
to believe that 2.82b was such a good release, there was no need to rush.

There's over 30 bugs fixed this time. A few features I had to withhold for
2.82b have been added; sample loop markers and some changes to the board
file format necessitated the bump to 2.83. Logicow's GLSL renderer has
finally made it in (various bits had to be re-written to extend
portability to other platforms).

There's a new (semi-complete) Android port this time; I hope to complete
it, and provide binaries for Android 2.0 phones, in 2.83b.

Thanks go out to the usual suspects -- Terryn, Mr_Alert, Logicow, kvance,
Lancer-X, revvy and Exophase -- for supporting development this year.

USERS

+ Added support for loop markers in WAV and OGG files. The WAV loop support uses
  the "smpl" chunk used by ModPlug Tracker and Wavosaur among others. Only the
  first loop is used, and only forward looping is supported. The OGG loop
  support uses the "LOOPSTART" and "LOOPLENGTH" tags as used by RPG Maker VX.
  (Mr_Alert)
+ Added OpenGL Shader Language (glsl) renderer which uses shaders to render
  and scale the video. This renderer is compatible with Open GL >=2.0 and
  Open GL-ES 2.0 video cards only. A variety of shader programs have been
  provided and these can be customized. Performance of all MZX modes
  (including SMZX) is excellent. (Logicow, ajs)
+ Files will no longer be silently overwritten by save dialogs if the user
  enters an existing filename without the default extension. (revvy)
+ The string editor in the counter debug menu (F11) now escapes newlines
  and backslashes to prevent UI corruption.
+ Fix a bug where the LOAD_GAME counter handler could continue to use the
  old board state after load, causing crashes. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where status counters containing numbers >6 characters would
  cause MegaZeux to crash or behave strangely.
+ Fix a bug in the robot editor's find/replace function that caused crashes
  when replacing a string with another longer string, with a replacement at
  the end of a line.
+ Programmatically writing to a read-only "built-in" counter will no longer
  allocate it general heap space. This prevents writes from showing up in
  the F11 counter debugger that are inaccessible from robotic.
+ Fix a bug that caused the SMZX mode 3 palette to become corrupted upon
  entering the char editor (the editor would re-write colours 2-4 and not
  restore them from backup correctly).
+ Fix a bug where a robot program would never progress if the subroutine
  stack was popped more times than it was pushed (via return or top).
+ On UNIX platforms a desktop/menu entry is now installed by default, using
  the existing icon. (Sci-freak)
+ Clamp score to >= 0 if world <= 2.70. Fixes "Gates: The Puzzles" and
  possibly other old titles depending on this behavior. (Exophase)
+ Fullscreen modes will now automatically use your current desktop resolution
  if using any hardware renderer (i.e. not the default software renderer). To
  get the old behaviour back you must set fullscreen_resolution explicitly.
+ Fix a bug where web and thick web would be treated the same.
+ Fixed a bug in the updater where modified/replaced files would be considered
  for deletion.
+ Fixed a bug on case-sensitive filesystems where saving a game, world or MZM
  could fail to overwrite any existing file by the same name (if matched
  case insensitively).
+ Do not apply masking to chars 32-127 in signs or scrolls when playing a
  world. Previously, even the mask_midchars option would have no effect on
  the display of signs or scrolls. This has been broken since 2.80g.
+ Re-work board editor's Alt+H option to provide minimal editor (one row)
  status info, rather than completely hiding the help.
+ The checkres utility now checks the global robot and custom sfx tables
  for missing resources.
+ Chests can be added with Hi Bombs (omission noted by zzo38).
+ Fix IF c?? Sprite p?? # # "label" so that a non-wildcard parameter is
  respected (previously it would always just check sprite 0).
+ NDS port updated from dsmzx2 release. (kvance, ajs)
+ Updated SDL to 1.2.14 in Windows x86, Windows x64 and Mac OS X builds.
+ Security checks are no longer applied to filenames in module or sample
  playback in "listening only" modes in the editor.
+ Module volume is applied immediately before playback upon switching boards.
  This prevents one cycle of audio "leaking" at the wrong volume.
+ Prevent crash with negative string clip where clip + offset = 0. Clip is
  now correctly limited to total string length.
+ Help file is now optional for MZXRun, even with CONFIG_HELPSYS=1 builds.
+ Fix crash when robot editor macros expanded other macros.
+ The lock icon is no longer missing from the Items THING menu (F4).
+ A world to start up with can now be passed to megazeux without the
  startup_file= prefix. This makes megazeux consistent with other
  applications.
+ SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE, SHOOTSEEKER and SPITFIRE now end the cycle, to restore
  compatibility with pre-port MZX and fix games such as Kya's Sword and
  Stones & Roks II.
+ Have IF [dir] PLAYER [color] [thing] [param] "label" interpret SEEK
  direction wrt robot coordinates, rather than player coordinates.
  Other directions are not affected.
+ Zapping a label at the end of a robot program will no longer corrupt the
  robot list, usually causing crashes.
+ Entering lines in the robot editor with leading or trailing spaces will be
  trimmed before the line is compiled.
+ The single quote characters encasing S_CHARACTER parameters in the robot
  editor will now use the protected (GUI) charset rather than the game one.
+ Add a "system_mouse" config.txt option that allows the mouse cursor to be
  replaced with the system mouse cursor, rather than being drawn by MegaZeux.
+ Disallow placing player clones with SET "board_id" 127.
+ Relaxed file name limit on board MOD file. The board MOD can now be as long
  as the limit imposed by file dialog's input box (previously limited to 12
  characters).
+ Truncation of currently open input/output file names will now only occur
  at MAX_PATH bytes (typically 512 characters). The previous limit was 13
  characters.
+ Relaxed limit of INPUT string and bottom ("*") messages from 80 characters
  to ROBOT_MAX_TR (512) characters. In the case of bottom messages this can
  be usefully exploited to ~200 characters.
+ Progress meter will be shown for world decrypt on console platforms.
+ Fix a bug where a malformatted BMP header would be written (length too
  short, didn't include dummy channel in BMP palette). (Mr_Alert)
+ Optimize audio locking; do file I/O outside of critical sections to
  decrease stalling, particularly on platforms with slow I/O. (Mr_Alert)
+ Added support for MacOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and removed support for 10.3.
+ Loading a save game from robotic will now correctly restore intensities
  to their saved values.
+ Copy/pasting a block either with COPY BLOCK or the editor, where the
  copy would exceed the limit on robots/signs/scrolls/sensors, will no
  longer place junk at the target co-ordinates. Instead, the object's
  background will be copied in isolation.
+ Pasting from the clipboard, expanding a macro,  or importing .txt
  or .bc files that would cause a robot to exceed the 64k limit now has
  the operation ignored at the point it exceeds the limit, rather than
  adding an unlimited number of unrecognized lines.
+ Fix a bug with the pc_speaker_on option which could cause the audio
  thread to block indefinitely when PC speaker audio was disabled.

DEVELOPERS

+ MZXRun compilation can now be disabled. Compilation of pre-2.82b style
  non-modular builds requires `--disable-modular --disable-mzxrun'.
+ Disabling SDL can now be done with --disable-sdl and the resulting
  configuration will automatically disable any SDL-dependent components.
  This is useless to anybody except developers doing new ports.
+ Game directory, utility directory and resource directories can now
  be specified and will be respected on "make install". (Sci-freak, ajs)
+ Added experimental port to Android. See arch/android/README for more
  information.
+ Ported opengl1 and opengl2 renderers to OpenGL ES 1.x and glsl renderer
  to OpenGL ES 2.0, used increasingly by mobile devices.
+ Removed SDL dependency from NDS port. It only used it for timing and
  stuffed events.
+ On Windows platforms, binaries are processed with the `pefix' in-tree
  tool to eliminate data section differences in programs with identical
  texts. This minimizes the amount of content required to be sent for
  updates.
+ Updated Wii port: improved audio and video support, added USB mouse
  support, numerous optimizations and improved file selector. (Mr_Alert)

December 29, 2008 - MZX 2.82b

This release contains plenty of important bug fixes, ranging from regressions
such as the broken command-line editor macro expansion to third party bugs
like the Windows "directx" SDL video driver breakage.

There are also some new ports and features. MegaZeux now runs on the Wii (port
by Mr_Alert) and AmigaOS 4.x (port by myself and Spot from os4depot). The
Windows x64 port has matured immensely and can now be considered stable.
MacOS X builds now have clipboard support. The hardware stretching renderers
now have a couple of fixed aspect ratio modes.

The biggest feature of this release is the introduction of a portable network
layer, which is currently being tested by the new built-in updater (F7/U).

Internally, MegaZeux is now modularized and builds as several DLL and EXE
files, which should make redesigning parts like the help system and editor
a little easier, as well as allowing us to ship a "mzxrun" executable for
the first time since 2.69c. This "mzxrun" executable is now used by a
majority of the console ports.

Contributions from Revvy, Mr_Alert, Terryn and Exophase have helped make
this another solid release.

USERS

+ Writing to $str.length (which previously did undefined things) will now
  truncate or enlarge the string to the size specified.
+ Removed filename size limit for FWRITE_MODIFY and FWRITE_APPEND. (Revvy)
+ Added support to the checkres tool to check worlds in non-local
  directories. (Revvy)
+ Fix an old bug with saving games and worlds from Robotic where a board could
  be prematurely "optimized", renumbering robot IDs within the same cycle. For
  commands like DIE this could cause unpredictable behaviour or simply crashes
  (if invoked in the same cycle). As a special case, end the cycle if either
  of these SET specials are used.
+ Mistaken or malicious file I/O such as set "$test" to "fread(-1>>1)" will
  no longer crash MegaZeux. The read size will be truncated to a contextual
  maximum for the current file.
+ Fixed a crash using "fwrite0" in conjunction with an empty string.
+ Fixed a bug where checking sprite_collisions on a disabled target sprite
  would unconditionally trigger (regardless of whether a collision was
  present or not).
+ Un-group the handling of the KEY and KEYn counters so that different
  compatibility checks can be applied to either counter. Fixes
  "Bocco Chronicles 1" and probably several other titles.
+ Fix a crash when using RIDn or ROBOT_ID_n in the same cycle as DIE for
  another robot positioned earlier in the board scan.
+ Fix poor sanity checks on BOARD_ID counter writes. Illegal character IDs such
  as -1 can no longer be used to bypass the check (causing subsequent crashes).
+ Windows builds now use a patched version of SDL 1.2.13 containing a fix
  for the directx+F10 issue.
+ Fix a bug where one robot could send another robot to "#return", with an
  address outside its program. In such cases, the robot will now terminate.
+ A "mzxrun" binary is now shipped alongside the editor-capable MZX binary.
+ Fix TIME/TIMERESET overflows with very large values. Board timeout is now
  programmatically limited to 32767, which is consistent with the Board Info
  control.
+ Clamp CHAR_X/CHAR_Y properly so that negative numbers can no longer be used
  to corrupt the editor charset and potentially other process memory.
+ Fix recent breakage of SHIFT+F{1,2,3,4} so that the percentage time spent
  displaying the original character and the '!' are equal.
+ Remove some bogus handling of lines containing "only" ';', ',' or ' '.
+ Honor user's robot character selection if they are holding shift when
  pressing return or space (would previously always return char 247).
+ Backspacing a line and then expanding a macro no longer restores the
  original line contents immediately after the expansion.
+ MacOS 10.x clipboard support (via Cocoa Pasteboard). Alt+Ins can be entered
  with Fn+Alt+Numpad0 on a Macbook or Powerbook keyboard.
+ Rendering glitches are no longer encountered when using the ' S_CHARACTER.
+ Fix robot editor glitches where the game charset SPACE would be used in
  places where the protected UI charset should be used instead.
+ The introductory help message is displayed if the load dialog is cancelled
  prior to loading a game. Hopefully the screen is now never totally blank.
+ The F7/F8 cheats can now be used freely in MZXRun (in MegaZeux proper they
  remain usable only in editor tests).
+ Saving to a directory above the MegaZeux startup directory, then attempting
  to save to this location again, will no longer crash MegaZeux. Instead, the
  parent directory will be changed into before the dialog is displayed.
+ Fixed numerous crash bugs with the scroll editor; it should be relatively
  usable now.
+ Writing to $str+0 is no longer interpreted in the same way as a plain
  write to $str. Instead, it behaves like writes to non-zero offsets (as more
  of a paste than a replace).
+ Display current X,Y position of robot in the robot editor status bar.
+ Fix directory rename so that it no longer displays garbage and/or crashes
  MegaZeux (Alt+R to rename a directory in any file picker).
+ In the robot editor, lines can now be split at a midpoint with enter and
  two consecutive lines merged together with backspace. (Exophase)
+ Fix use of status counter 6 and display of status counters in general,
  which has been broken since 2.80.
+ Fix swapping to encrypted worlds if initially the user decides to not
  decrypt the world. Previously, this would either crash, or loop forever.
- Removed the legacy "force_resolution" option which was replaced long ago
  by the more accurate "fullscreen_resolution" option.
+ When using the OpenGL or overlay renderers, in either windowed or
  fullscreen mode, the aspect ratio can now be preserved as either 4:3
  (most similar to DOS) or 64:35 (most similar to the port). The display
  will be letterboxed or margins applied as appropriate. See the
  "video_ratio" configuration option for more information.
+ Fixed a bug on some systems where numlock could not be used as a key,
  only as a flag. The numlock "key" is now masked out of "key_code" and
  similar; hopefully this won't break any games.
+ Restored the meter widget from the old DOS MZX for use with the world
  loader and saver routines. This reassures users, especially on consoles,
  where loading a world can take a long time. (Mr_Alert)
+ On Windows, directx.bat now passes %cd% through to `start' so that features
  such as the updater continue to work. (MZXGiant)
+ Pasting into a string with set "$str+N" with an N > str.length will no
  longer crash MZX.
+ "Exit to DOS" is now "Exit MegaZeux" to reflect the multi-platform nature
  of the program.
+ Setting a substring size to zero with $string#0 will no longer return the
  whole string; it will instead return the empty string.
+ Accessing a substring with an offset >= $string.length will no longer return
  the last character from the string; it will instead return the empty string.
+ Writing beyond MAX_STRING_LEN (1MB) or using negative offsets (which has the
  same effect) no longer crashes. Instead, the write is ignored.
+ Fix crash when pasting to and from the same string, specifically in
  conjunction with $str+offset.
+ Fix bug where altering "num" in a GO DIR [num] or WAIT [num] while in
  process could cause the robot to stall forever. The robot will now only
  wait for either the cycles it has waited already, or the current "num"
  at that cycle.

DEVELOPERS

+ Ported to OpenSolaris. You need to install `SUNWxorg-headers' if you want
  X11 clipboard support.
+ Remove dependency on SDL_image on non-win32 platforms when enabling
  the icon branding feature (see pngops.c).
+ Ported to AmigaOS. You need to install the clib2 version of libSDL and
  miniGL, and the build system assumes you are using a cross compiler.
+ Added experimental port to the Wii. See arch/wii/README for more
  information. (Mr_Alert)
+ get_path() in util.c now returns <0 for failure, or the length of the path
  for the given file. (Revvy)
+ Add a valgrind.supp file to suppress bugs in third party libraries when
  valgrinding MegaZeux.
+ Cleaned up all the ports and documented making new ports. The platforms
  "linux", "solaris" and "obsd" are now called "unix" and the "linux-static"
  platform is now "unix-devel" and available on all UNIX derivatives/clones.
+ Add a special hack to enable linking with --as-needed for DT_NEEDED link
  optimization for GNU ld platforms.
+ Updated MSVC projects. Fixed all warnings emitted by MSVC 2008, and
  implemented icon support with existing mingw resource files.
+ Use the GNU ld "debuglink" feature on all platforms to enable shipping of
  a side-by-side symbol package. Optimized release builds can now be
  debugged with minimal user effort.
- Removed HOST_CC feature for cross compilation; since the utilities now
  intimately depend on the MZX runtime, they must be built with the same
  compiler.
+ MegaZeux now provides the option for "modular" linkage, factoring out the
  "core", "editor" and "network" features to shared objects that other
  binaries can link against. This feature works on the unix, mingw,
  amiga and darwin ports.
+ Added RPM .spec file. Capable of building (at least) Fedora 10 RPMs.

June 10, 2008 - MZX 2.82

Despite the increase in minor version, this release mostly targets bug and
regression fixes. However, there ARE some additional new features, such as
the introduction of the LOAD_MENU and mouse pixel counters, and refinement
of the {FREAD,FWRITE}_COUNTER counter. (There are several other smaller
features that are documented in the changelog.)

SAVs from older worlds (requiring compatibility hacks) no longer fail to
play (Darkness, etc. are affected). We've also done a good bit to fix
compatibility with 2.70 and older.

A new tool, "checkres", is now routinely packaged, allowing you to check
your games for missing resource files (PALs, CHRs, etc.) before passing
them on to other people. This should be especially handy for DoZ game
submissions.

The Nintendo DS port (Kevin Vance's "DsMZX") has been merged into this
release. I'll provide binaries for GP2X, PSP and NDS this time, but I
can't guarantee they'll work.

Both of the snags from the last DoZ have been addressed -- the help system
should no longer crash and the Block Action crashes should be reduced in
frequency. However, there are still issues with pasting in the robot editor
that remain unfixed (they're just really hard to reproduce). With your bug
reports, I look forward to fixing this.

As usual, thanks go out to Revvy and Mr_Alert for their contributions to
the bug-fixing effort, and to Terryn for his unwavering dedication to
creating and organising bug reports, and for testing our bug fixes.

USERS

+ Fixed and improved quality of the half-width renderer for the GP2X port
  (Mr_Alert).
+ Have the numpad work correctly when numlock is disabled. Keys are no longer
  ignored by the MZX editor, and games should recognize them as before.
+ Added a tool, "checkres", which extracts all resources from a MegaZeux
  world or board file and lists them (or lists only those which are not
  found in the game directory. ZIP files are also supported (to a more
  limited extent) (ajs & Revvy, ideas from Exophase & Terryn).
+ Removed the bogus "F1 for Help" option from error dialogs, and finally
  get rid of the "** BETA **" banner on title boards in play mode.
+ Obsolete support for the AMS, DBM, DMF, MDL, MT2, PSM, PTM and UMX module
  formats. As noted for several versions in the help file, these are not
  loadable by MikMod. It is extremely unlikely any game uses these obscure
  formats, but denying their use is now enforced (at a robotic level).
+ Fix crash when writing to a MZX string at an illegal offset (< 0).
+ Fix returning from a subroutine invoked by a jump from a MZX text box
  class command so that it no longer skips the next impending line (after
  the text box).
+ Assemble single non-alphanum/punctuation characters as bytecode CHARACTER
  instead of bytecode STRING. Fixes bogus auto-quoting for commands like
  SCROLL CHAR (Revvy).
+ Switch the Win32 package back to using the "windib" SDL video driver,
  instead of the "directx" SDL video driver. The windib.bat file has been
  replaced with directx.bat, which has opposing semantics.
+ SAM/GDMs with converted WAV/S3M counterparts of zero length will be
  automatically re-converted. This hack can be used to procedurally
  regenerate WAV files from SAMs, or transparently work around on-disk
  corruption.
+ Strings are now limited to a maximum length of 1M. I'm open to suggestions
  over a better limit, but there must be a limit (set "$string.X" notation
  grows a string arbitrarily, so robotic can crash MZX when a string is resized
  beyond a reasonable limit).
+ Strings, when grown, will fill gaps with ' ' instead of garbage. This can be
  useful when the string grows after using the set "$string.X" notation; the
  rest of the string is no longer garbage, allowing the debugger to be used.
+ A robot that does a "put c?? Thing p?? [dir] player" and overwrites itself
  will no longer leak commands. Instead, if the robot overwrites itself, its
  program will end.
+ Fix message edges always showing up black, instead of whatever color 0
  is. (Revvy)
+ Change starting/max health and lives minimum to 1 instead of 0. (Revvy)
+ Some help system (F1) bugs have been fixed, hopefully mitigating some of
  the crashes people have been seeing.
+ Fix a bug on Linux where fclose() on a robot-opened file could, on world
  reload, occassionally crash (due to a stale handle). Fixes loading Toayarin
  saves multiple times in a row.
+ The new option "gl_vsync" has been added to allow the SDL "flip on vsync"
  in the OpenGL renderers to be forcibly enabled or disabled. This fixes a
  problem where speed 1 would only be as fast as the video refresh rate.
+ Setting the music volume to 0 (when using the ModPlug engine) now ensures
  that no music is audible. Previously, setting the volume to 0 would be
  equivalent to setting the volume to 1, which was still audible.
+ Upon exiting the initial load screen, and not entering the editor, the
  screen is now updated. This fixes rendering glitches in the MZX game
  window when overlapping the window with another, at the slight expense
  of CPU time.
+ If loading a save game from the title screen (or when no world has been
  loaded) do not send JUSTENTERED to all robots. This restores compatibility
  with MZX 2.70 and is consistent with loading a save from another board.
+ Counters with 10 digits and a negative sign are no longer truncated in
  the debug menu.
+ Correctly clamp (rather than truncate) the value passed through to a
  SET COLOR. Restores compatibility with 2.70, and fixes Xenogenesis.
+ Improve clipboard copy behaviour on Linux. Some actions are still
  mysteriously broken.
+ Fix replacing with a blank string in conjunction with the replace all
  Ctrl+F action in the robot editor. The cursor can now no longer become
  negative, fixing numerous possible crashes on search/replace.
+ Fix loading the intrinsic SMZX palette when switching to SMZX modes
  from a game not in the same directory as the "smzx.pal" file.
+ Reloading a world that requires switching between SMZX and non-SMZX modes
  will now respect the world's intrinsic palette on the title screen. Fixes
  problems loading non-SMZX games after having an SMZX game loaded.
+ Clamp array offsets on boards. Some older MZX worlds are corrupted and
  have the endgame_{x,y} coordinates outside of the limits of the endgame
  board. Fixes "Fourth Power".
+ Where possible, version all counters that the port understands. This
  ensures that in the unlikely case that a game made with an older version
  of MZX (actually, with an older world magic) uses a counter that did not
  exist in that game's era, the port will no longer try to interpret it.
  Previously, only rid? and key? were versioned.
+ SAV files will now be stamped with the world magic of the world they
  were loaded from. This allows compatibility hacks to apply to SAV files
  as they would to worlds. (ajs, Terryn, Mr_Alert)
+ Add LOAD_MENU counter like ENTER_MENU, F2_MENU et al. to allow control
  (from robotic) over whether the LOAD_MENU can be brought up.
+ Have FREAD_COUNTER and FWRITE_COUNTER read in a DOS dword (32bit) instead
  of a DOS word (16bit). This allows modern post-port MZX counters to be
  fully represented in files. Compatibility with older worlds is preserved.
+ Add a new config option "board_editor_hide_help" which changes the default
  hide setting of the help text on the primary board editor.
+ Numerous fixes for bugs found by valgrind. (Nightwatch)
+ Icon support is now fixed and works on all platforms. On Windows, the
  icon cannot currently be changed (it is loaded from the EXE's resource
  section). Use ResHacker if you really want to change it.
+ Fixed a bug where either LOAD_ROBOTn or LOAD_BCn (where n was equal to
  ROBOT_ID) would alter the robot's line number rather than completely restart
  it. Due to complexities in robot context, this lead to the first line being
  skipped.
+ Added a new tool "downver" which supports drag-and-drop downgrading of
  a world or board from the version of MZX it is packaged with to the
  previous version of MZX. This tool may be unsafe to use -- be careful.
+ Fixed a bug in the robotic assembler which would occassionally emit corrupt
  programs with SAVE_ROBOT. These programs, if loaded by LOAD_ROBOT could
  cause a crash.
+ Added a config.txt (or command line) option "startup_editor" which, if set
  to a non-zero value, will start MegaZeux in the editor with a blank world.
+ Fix a bug where a robot's WALK processing, on entering a transporter, could
  allow subsequent commands (such as GO) to corrupt the board. WALK now ends
  the cycle in the special case that a robot goes through a transporter.
+ You can now directly import bytecode into the robot editor via the Alt+I
  menu. The extension for the bytecode file must .bc for it to be loaded.
+ A game loading SAVs via the LOAD_GAME counter will no longer crash MZX
  if the SAV attempted is from an incompatible version of MZX, or in any
  way corrupted.
+ Fix a crash when auto-completing lines that were greater than 241 characters
  in length after completion.
+ Added mouse pixel counters MOUSEPX and MOUSEPY. (Mr_Alert)
+ Commenting a line of maximum length (241 characters) can no longer grow the
  length of the line beyond this limit.
+ Fixed a bug causing the software renderer to fail to center when using a
  boxed fullscreen resolution. Also fixes a bug where the PSP platform would
  ignore an override of the force_bpp option. (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed a bug causing macros loaded from config.txt to be expanded
  incorrectly. Relatedly, fixed a bug where #<string> in the robot exitor
  would "disappear" on entry, if there was no correspondingly named macro.

DEVELOPERS

+ Don't initialize the SDL audio subsystem if audio is permanently disabled
  with --disable-audio.
+ Add fixes for OpenBSD to allow PNG screenshots and X11 clipboard support to
  work. Tested with OpenBSD 4.2 and GCC 3.3.5.
+ Updated Win32 builds with SDL 1.2.13.
+ Dependencies are now correctly tracked in the build system. Modifying a
  header will automatically regenerate the minimal set of object files that
  depend on this header.
+ Out of the box MSVC support. The file "msvc.zip" in the root of the source
  package now provides a Visual Studio 2005 project and pre-compiled
  dependencies. There may be stability issues with the resulting binary.
  See also the documentation in arch/msvc/README.txt.
+ The Nintendo DS port (a.k.a. 'dsmzx') has been merged. This is the most
  exotic port thus far, and adds features such as player focus (on the second
  display). Sound isn't working yet, and large games still won't play (due to
  lack of memory). See docs/nds.txt for more information. (kvance)
+ Many stack-heavy functions have been de-bloated and allocate large storage
  on the heap (if performance is not critical). This helps out platforms
  with a small, fixed stack size (such as NDS).
+ The built-in help system can now be disabled for embedded platforms.
  The startup check for the help file will not be performed if the help
  system is disabled, and so this file can be omitted from distributions.
+ The package.sh script now supports OS X, PSP, GP2X and NDS packaging.
+ The OS X port no longer requires Xcode. The new build system and package.sh
  can create a universal Application and corresponding DMG file. The new
  infrastructure deprecates the old macosx.zip method.
+ Most of the internal dependency on SDL has been removed. Therefore, MZX
  can be built (but not yet work) without SDL present. The only remaining
  component to convert is MikMod, but this can be disabled, so port authors
  can start using the feature right away (see config.sh). (Mr_Alert)

December 8, 2007 - MZX 2.81h

Another bugfix release with a couple of new features, in time for the
Winter 2007 Dualstream Day of Zeux. The major new features of this release
are automatic module renaming in the editor, PNG screenshots and many
improvements to MZX on embedded platforms (like PSP and DS).

MegaZeux can now be compiled in MZXRun mode (like the old DOS
implementation) and by disabling features such as unnecessary renderers
and audio support, can be made approximately 70% smaller.

Thanks again to Terryn for relentlessly tracking down many serious bugs;
we've tried to fix all the issues that have crept up in the last 5 months.

Thanks too to Exophase, Mr_Alert and Wervyn for contributing to this
release; your time and help is invaluable.

Happy Holidays!

USERS

+ Added a more lenient WAV file loader so that ModPlug isn't relied on as much
  to play malformed WAV files (mostly old SAM conversions) (Mr_Alert).
+ Added SCORE and mzx_speed to the counter debugger (Mr_Alert, ajs).
+ Added a 16-bit software renderer and a half-width renderer for the GP2X port
  (Mr_Alert).
+ Made the mouse cursor in the "opengl2" renderer look more like the mouse
  cursor in the other renderers (Mr_Alert).
+ Setting vlayer_size, vlayer_width or vlayer_height to values less than or
  equal to zero would crash MegaZeux. Limit the smallest vlayer size to 1x1.
+ Setting vlayer_width or vlayer_height to a value larger than vlayer_size
  would crash MegaZeux. Limit the largest size of either dimension to a
  maximum of vlayer_size.
+ If selecting a module with a non 8.3 filename, MZX will now ask you if you
  want to rename it to 8.3, and do so in an intelligent way. This means that
  music can be selected in the editor and correctly saved (Wervyn).
+ The OpenBSD compiler detected some serious string bugs in MegaZeux. These
  have now been fixed and should eliminate some more potential crashes.
+ Fixed a bug where an ENERGIZER item or use of the INVINCO counter would
  cause the original player color to be corrupted at the end of the colour
  blitz.
+ Fixed a long-standing bug where set "$string" to "FWRITEn" would be
  cheerfully ignored.
+ Fixed a bug where a corrupt robot list could crash MegaZeux (e.g. the
  list from Star Quest from DoZ'02).
+ FEATURE: Screenshots are now saved in a palettized PNG file format. For
  platforms without libpng, PNG support can be compiled out, and BMP will
  be used instead.
+ Fixed a bug where changing boards in the editor could sometimes corrupt
  memory, later causing a crash (either testing or coming out of testing a
  board).
+ Fixed a sensor bug that happens when a sensor can't go anywhere it is told
  to, and the player is on it (Exophase).
+ Fixed using ABORT LOOP in some situations. Using it outside of a loop
  still has undefined semantics and this has been documented in the help
  file (Exophase).
+ Setting a board option below its numeric limit is no longer
  possible (Exophase).
+ Fixed problems with going over Robot name character limits using the .@
  command (Exophase).
+ Fixed problems with LOAD_ROBOT freezing on a robot with no newline at the
  end of the file.
+ Fixed a problem with "Replace All" in the robotic editor, that could
  sometimes cause a line to exceed 240 characters and crash the editor.
+ Fixed a problem with "Replace" in the robotic editor, which could cause a
  line to temporarily become 241 characters and then truncate silently to
  240 characters.
+ Fix a bug that caused the original game palette to be lost when testing
  a game in the editor that switched between Regular/SMZX1 and SMZX2/3 modes.
  MegaZeux should now try much harder to preserve the user palette,
  regardless of game edits.
+ Fix a bug causing board switching to not correctly alter the x,y viewport
  scroll leading to the display of raw memory and potentially crashes, with
  differently sized boards.
+ Fixed stack corruption caused by SCROLL CHAR SOUTH, detected by Ubuntu's
  SSP (Stack Smashing Protection) enabled binary.

DEVELOPERS

+ Made the build system less verbose by default (like Linux). This should help
  make warnings (due to coding errors) easier to identify. If you don't like
  the new syntax, or need the command debug, you can build with "make V=1".
+ Updated Win32 builds with SDL 1.2.12.
+ Rewrote the build system to not use recursive Makefiles. Variable propagation
  was starting to be a problem, and recursive designs are generally discouraged.
+ Refactored the graphics rendering code to modularize the renderers and reduce
  code duplication (Mr_Alert).
+ GDM2S3M switched over to use inttypes.h instead of home-brew types.
+ MegaZeux now compiles on OpenBSD (and probably other BSDs).
+ Made all unnecessary global symbols static. This should improve compiler
  optimisations and correctness (Mr_Alert, ajs).
+ Fix compilation of MegaZeux against SDL 1.3 SVN. However, this SDL version
  is still in development, and MegaZeux does not work correctly when compiled
  against it.
+ MegaZeux now builds with the experimental MINGW-x64 branch, enabling x64
  binaries for Windows.
+ MegaZeux now builds with MSVC if you apply the patch from contrib/,
    megazeux-r326-replace-c99-variable-arrays-with-malloc-free.diff
  This patch is required for MSVC because it makes non-compiler-specific
  changes (which involve converting from C99 variable length arrays to
  malloc/free) which are slower and should not be used with competent
  C99 compilers like GCC.
  Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition 2005 was used to build libogg,
  libvorbis, libsdl and MegaZeux itself. Only 32bit builds were tested.
+ MegaZeux now has size optimisations which can reduce binary size when
  features are disabled. For example, all renderers can now be disabled,
  and when module engines are disabled, audio will not export any symbols.
+ The entire audio subsystem can now be disabled. This further reduces
  binary size on embedded platforms. However, SFX editing still remains
  enabled (though useless) until editor modularity is implemented.
+ The PSP port is now officially supported, and compiles out of the box.
  See docs/psp.txt.
+ Renamed macos platform "darwin", to reflect its true nature (use Xcode to
  build as a real Application, instead of just a UNIX binary). Also fixed
  some bogosities with robo_ed's X11 includes on OS 10.5.
+ The editor can now be disabled, a la MZXRUN from the old DOS versions.
  Configure with --disable-editor to shrink MZX by about 150k.
+ MegaZeux can now be compiled with size optimisations (--optimize-size to
  config.sh) for a 20% space saving.
+ MegaZeux's core now builds with -W (basically all GCC warnings) plus
  some additional warnings that aren't switched on by this flag. All
  warnings have been fixed.

July 4, 2007 - MZX 2.81g

Again, no significant new features have been introduced in this release.
However, there have been many essential bugfixes, including improved
compatibility with games made in older versions of MegaZeux.

Additionally, improvements have been made to the opengl2 and overlay2
renderers, improving performance for most users. A port of MegaZeux to the
GP2X console has been added. MegaZeux has been backported to C (rather than
C++) and can operate correctly on a CPU without a floating-point unit.

Particular thanks go out to Mr_Alert (for his valuable bug fixes),
Lancer-X (for fixing what I was too lazy to) and Terryn (for finding many
annoying bugs that nobody else could).

USERS

+ Fixed a bug in the audio code. The linear resampler was not taking volume
  into account, which broke changing the volume of samples (WAV and Vorbis)
  which cannot natively alter their volumes.
+ Fixed a regression in the overlay editor caused by the new editor space
  semantics.
+ Screenshots are now rendered to a separate texture using the 8bit software
  renderer. This means that the hardware scalers will not affect the quality
  of the screenshot. It also fixes a bug when using opengl2, which would dump
  only a white screen.
+ Temporarily reverted a bugfix that broke Zeux IV - Forest of Ruin. I'm not
  dropping the bugfix, I just can't immediately see what's wrong.
+ Fixed a bug where setting the viewport to negative coordinates would crash
  MegaZeux. There was code to handle this, but it was wrong.
+ Fixed a bug that permitted the mouse y coordinate to be warped to row 25,
  which does not exist. This bug caused some of the renderers to crash, and
  the software renderer to draw in memory it did not possess.
+ Fixed a bug where games made before 2.68 could have available the "key?"
  counters, unsupported in that version. This caused collisions with counters
  with the key? name used with inc/dec/mul/div/mod. Fixes "Doom Keep".
+ Imported libmodplug 0.8.4, which adds MIDI/PAT and ABC format support,
  fixes some bugs in the mixer, and should build on more platforms.
  NOTE: MID files currently cannot be selected in the editor, because they
        do not play correctly.
+ Improved the performance of the "opengl2" renderer, by removing the
  convoluted 3D drawing commands and replacing them with 2D ones. Reduced the
  quad count by using an intermediary 80x25 texture. MegaZeux now depends on
  fewer GL features (LogiCow).
+ Introduced an "fsafegets" to work around problems where robots exported by
  a Windows version of MegaZeux would not load on other platforms. This was
  due to differing EOL style and broke at least one game (Termination).
+ Renamed "force_resolution" to "fullscreen_resolution" to better match its
  semantics with the scaling renderers. The new name is less accurate for
  software render modes, but most people using software will not want to
  change it from the default anyway.
+ Fix a bug where the variable-length string allocator would prematurely
  bail out when reading a string (of indeterminate length) from a file with
  the set "$var" to "FREAD" syntax.
+ Fix a bug where more than 256 errors would crash the robotic checker.
+ Improved performance of the overlay2 (faster) renderer (Mr_Alert).
+ Make the transparent overlay "really" transparent when used in conjunction
  with sprites (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug reported by Mr_Alert where MZX would not handle short,
  non-looping mods in the editor. The editor would try to destroy the mod
  again, even after the callback had destroyed it (premature termination).
+ Fixed a bug with SWAP WORLD where file translation would occur but the
  result would mistakenly not be used. This broke some uses of SWAP WORLD
  on non-Windows platforms (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where using JUMP to MOD ORDER right after switching boards
  would fail due to the board music not having been loaded yet (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where games made before 2.80 would inadvertently trigger
  "PLAYERHURT" due to using the SET command to reduce the amount of
  health (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where player clones where generated when entering transports
  during FREEZETIME (Lancer-X).
+ Debug menu is now eradicated on leaving the editor (Lancer-X).
+ Debug menu is now properly painted over when the board size is < the editor
  viewport. Fixes various graphical glitches (Lancer-X).
+ Fix a crash bug when playing older MZX games from read-only media (such as a
  CD) or where file-system permissions prohibited creating SAM conversions
  (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed bug where certain file formats would not be automatically converted
  if their extensions were mixed or upper case (e.g. OGG/SAM/GDM).
+ Restored functionality of "if lasttouched DIR" which has been broken since
  MZX 2.02.
+ Fixed a bug where attempting to decrypt a read-only world file would result
  in a crash (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed several bugs where an error loading a world file would result in
  crashes in several different situations (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where a robot using the BECOME command to change into a
  PushableRobot or vice versa would freeze (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed memory leaks in the file selection dialog, the counter debugger, the
  collision list and the global robot (Mr_Alert).
+ Updated counter list (see docs/counter_list.txt in the source) (Terryn).
+ Fixed a bug where pressing escape when editing the effect of a ring or potion
  would result in an invalid parameter which would later cause a crash if
  edited again (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug in which robot-driven text boxes using option commands (the ?
  command) could overflow by two characters and spill over the side (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed the list box searching mechanism (used in the file manager and F11
  counter list) and made the existing function more understandable. (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed a bug in which the message string given to the 'ask' command could
  spill over. Now, the 'ask' dialog resizes if possible, and clips when no
  further resizing can be performed (Lancer-X).
+ Clipped the 'input string' message properly, to prevent similar overflow.
+ Fixed a bug with the EXPLODE, DIE, DIE ITEM and BECOME commands when used
  with the global robot (would clear the global robot, eventually corrupting
  memory when in the editor). Presumably, these commands are bogus for the
  global robot, and have been disabled.

DEVELOPERS

+ Rewrote config.sh to use POSIX sh compatible functions, so that there is
  no dependency on the BASH interpreter. Surprisingly, some distributions
  still don't enable BASH by default (using csh, ash or zsh instead).
+ Ported most of MegaZeux back to C. This should further reduce the platform
  requirements for running MZX, and enable marginally faster compilation.
+ Enabled GCC's -W flag for even more warnings, switching off unused
  parameter warnings (useful for delegates). Mostly typing fixes, but it
  found a bug in string handling.
+ No longer suppress char-subscript warnings, and fix up any remaining
  abuses in the tree.
+ Add manpages for 'megazeux' and other binaries for the Debian packages.
  Comply with the Debian packaging guidelines by providing a copyright
  note, listing significant contributors to MegaZeux.
+ Added support to the build system for supporting icons modularly.
  See contrib/icons/README for more information.
+ The debug build (make DEBUG=1) now enables GCC 4.x's stack protector. This
  breaks compatibility with GCC 3.x, but you can just remove the flag if you
  don't want to use it (the stack protector will improve stack corruption
  detection and provide more usable debug traces).
+ Custom Random() implementation to provide a more uniform number
  distribution. Factored out for future (better) implementations.
+ The audio backend (audio.cpp) has been modularised to support the use of
  mikmod instead of modplug. This should enable ports of MZX to platforms
  without an FPU, and improve performance on platforms with weak FPUs.
+ Added GP2X port to config.sh, based on work done by Simon Parzer.

January 30, 2007 - MZX 2.81f

This release is mostly about the new renderers, the first of which was
introduced in the previous version. There's also a few important bugfixes,
and a lot of internal tidy-up work. I'd like to thank Mr_Alert, Quantum P.
and LogiCow for contributing to this release. Thanks guys.

USERS

+ Renamed the force_32bpp config option to force_bpp, in preparation for
  16bit OpenGL render modes. This option now takes 8, 16 or 32. 16 is
  reportedly broken on Windows, so stick to 32 for now.
- The force_height_multiplier option has been removed. A lot of code
  wasn't properly designed to handle it, there have been mouse warp bugs
  with it for years, and nobody seems to use it. If people want stretching,
  they can choose one of the four hardware renderers to achieve this.
+ Added infrastructure for "pluggable" renderers. This code isn't perfect,
  but it's far better than the mess in 'e'. Defaults to the 'software'
  render mode.
+ Added Logicow's alternative OpenGL renderer. For more information about
  this renderer, see config.txt. NOTE: This code may be buggy! Please test!
+ Added Mr Alert's YUV overlay renderers. One does full YUV macropixel
  approximation, the other (faster) render does chroma supersampling. See
  config.txt for more information. NOTE: This code may be buggy! Please test!
+ Simplified Exophase's OpenGL renderer present in 'e', and fixed a few bugs
  that caused it to not work for some people.
+ Really made MegaZeux use 'directx' by default on Windows. The code in 'e'
  was non-functional. Use 'windib.bat' to run MegaZeux with the SDL windib
  driver.
+ The OpenGL renderers now have a 'filter' option that allows you to choose
  linear (where pixels are interpolated, looks "blurred") or nearest (where
  nearest-neighbour approximation occurs, looks "sharp").
+ Mouse warping was broken when using any of the hardware renderers. There
  should be code in there now to take account of this (thanks Mr_Alert).
+ Added an option 'editor_spaces_toggle' which allows you to revert MZX's
  space overwrite behavior to the semantics of 'd' (the feature was
  removed in 'e'). By default, the behavior is unchanged.
+ F6 (the debug menu) can now no longer be enabled anywhere but in the
  editor Alt-T test mode. In 'e', it was possible to enable on the title
  screen, but could not be enabled in a game. Like the cheats, this option
  is now visible only in test mode.
- Removed the 'lame/1337' menu feature.
+ Fixed a bug where the global robot could be exited via some legal commands,
  in an abnormal fashion. The bug resulted in all the code up to the offending
  command being executed over and over.

DEVELOPERS

+ OpenGL can now be disabled via config.sh. This allows MegaZeux ebuilds
  to be constructed on systems that do not have any form of OpenGL support.
  (Although MZX runtime loads the OpenGL library, 'e' required the headers
   to build correctly. This is now no longer the case.)
+ On Windows, due to an ATi driver bug, I have provided a means of linking
  directly to opengl32.dll, instead of relying on the dynamic loader. This
  reduces binary portability, but fixes many bug reports of being unable
  to fullscreen on ATi video cards. See OPENGL_LINKING for more information.
+ Improved support for cross compiling with mingw32 on Linux, combined the
  win32 Makefile with this new support.
+ Rewrote the config.sh script. All of the options have changed, and the
  broken platform auto-detection has been removed. See ./config.sh for more
  information.
+ Rejigged MegaZeux's headers so that they can be used in both C and C++
  mode. Renamed fsafeopen.cpp to fsafeopen.c. Hopefully by 'g' most of
  MegaZeux should be ported back to C, instead of the "C++" it is now.
+ Fixed up the 'txt2hlp' utility which Terryn has been using a version of
  to build the internal MZX help system. This binary is built in the source
  distribution, but it is not distributed with the MegaZeux binaries.
+ Moved some antiquated Greg code out into 'old'. No attempt has been made
  to make it compile, it is provided purely for reference.
+ For the windows binaries, "windib.bat" is now generated by package.sh
  and auto-generated for the name of the MegaZeux executable.
+ Updated Xcode package from Quantum P. (see macosx.zip).

January 18, 2007 - MZX 2.81e

+ Made grabbing in the editor not combine background color, only uses
  "special" in game colors for player, tell me if anything ends up being
  weird because of this.
+ Possibly fixed an obscure bug where moving something happened
  immediately if it was sent to a label by a robot further east/south than
  it and it moved north or west (has to do with the way robots are
  reverse scanned). Tell me if this changed any behavior for the worse and
  I'll change it back or try to work out something new.
+ Added GDMs to ctrl + n, this will of course auto convert and play the
  s3m.
+ Added ability to preset player locked status from board settings.
- Removed ability to change SMZX mode ingame (F11)
+ Instead added ability to debug variables (counters and strings)
  ingame with F11. There's also an option to export the current variables
  to Robotic program that sets them.
+ Fixed bug where moving a block with the player into an overlapping
  region leaves a space where the player was.
+ Fixed bug with a robot indirectly sending itself to a subroutine via
  send all or send name causing it to loop the send.
+ Added compatability hacks for key# prior to MZX 2.69 worlds and
  ridNAME falling through in MZX 2.70 and earlier worlds.
+ F6, F7, F8, and F11 debug/cheat keys only work in editing mode now
  (as things were prior to the port) You can still save/load in the editor
  so if you want all of these things you can play the game from the start
  there.
+ Space in the editor no longer deletes something of similar type that is
  beneath not sure what the point of this was anyway.
+ Fixed bug causing cursor to clipped be out of bounds in SMZX char editor
  if changing to smaller multichar edit region.
+ Accidentally messed up screen centering in fullscreen for 32bpp mode,
  fixed.
+ Added hardware scaling option. You can now supply a window resolution
  besides 640x350 and allow for window resizing if hardware scaling is on;
  this will also scale fullscreen output to fill the entire screen. This
  can slow down rendering somewhat.
+ Fixed bug causing flip block to crash in the editor.
+ Made blocked directions relative to the player for put dir player.
+ Fixed bug where putting something to a direction relative the player
  overwriting the robot could crash MZX.
+ Fixed ability to input in input boxes by clicking on their question
  string.
+ Removed the bogus patch to Modplug and correctly fixed it in the build
  system.
+ Added 'debian' subdirectory for building Debian and Ubuntu upstream
  packages. Hopefully MegaZeux will be in the primary pool in a few
  months.
+ Added OS X xcode project files (see 'macosx.zip'). Fixed many bugs
  relating to endian that caused MegaZeux to be buggy on big-endian
  architectures (like PPC). Credit goes to Quantum P for finding these
  bugs and engineering high quality solutions.
+ Made 'directx' the default video render again on Windows. NOTE: This
  overrides the default SDL behaviour, but will not be applied if you
  set SDL_VIDEODRIVER yourself.
+ Repaired the 'linux-static' target so that it no longer includes a
  system C++ library, which caused unpredictable results on distros
  without a static version.
+ Fixed a locking bug with the audio code that caused hangs at startup
  on OS X. Also provided a mutex implementation using GNU pthreads as
  a temporary workaround for an SDL bug on the Linux platform.
+ Added PlayStation Portable (PSP) port. This code was written by Exophase
  and is highly experimental. It may not work at all for you. Please
  see docs/build.txt for more information regarding this port.
+ Fixed mouse movement from being affected by height_multiplier when
  not in fullscreen mode
+ Fixed height_multiplier config.txt option allowing you to enter really
  stupid values (like negatives, 0, and values too large for the
  resolution)
+ Added in an extra video mode check to stop MZX crashing on video modes
  that the video card can not reproduce
+ Fixed Avalanche to a constant placement rate of 1/18 (this caused MZX
  to deliver an uneven number of boulders, and crash with certain board
  sizes
+ Fixed sprite collision box to stop MZX from crashing when stupid values
  are entered
+ Fixed setting the viewport size to weird values like some old MZX games
  do
+ Default fullscreen resolution is now 640x480, this can be changed in
  config.txt
+ The config.txt option force_32bpp is now enabled by default
+ Seeking with mod_position when using a .WAV file as background music
  now works (thanks Mr_Alert)

December 10, 2006 - MZX 2.81d

+ Fixed a compilation failure on Linux, due to SDL no longer depending
  on libX11. Now we manually link X11 into MZX if necessary.
+ Various build system improvements, fixing bugs in the prefixing
  of dependencies.
+ New libmodplug 0.8 imported, fixing many endian problems on big-endian
  machines, integrating all of our local patches to 0.7.
+ Fixed bug causing MZX to freeze when starting up on Win9x machines.
+ Fix a warning generated by GCC 4.1.
+ Update the GPL boilerplates project-wide to the newest FSF address.
+ Fix a string range check causing an obscure crash in certain games.
+ Update the build.txt documentation.
+ Address documentation bugs found in the internal MZX help system (Terryn).
+ Fixed a recently introduced bug breaking the open command.
+ Fixed some bugs with changing params and pressing escape.

December 14, 2005 - MZX 2.81c

+ Oops, accidentally broke shift + F2. Fixed that..
+ Also accidentally broke &+counter& for full hex representation. Fixed.
+ Fixed memory leak problem with playing certain WAVs in a loop.
+ Fixed inconsistency of bad viewport sizes behaving differently on
  current versions from old DOS versions.
+ Accidentally broke joystick stuff in config.txt (has to do with way
  configure options were being read), fixed.
+ Fixed bug causing crash when loading MZBs larger than the current board
  size.
+ Made cursor hidden in alt + V in editor.
+ String comparison failed with nulls in the strings, fixed. Also
  should be slightly more optimal.
+ Fixed bug when using negative numbers for if sprite_colliding "counter"
+ Fixed math operations (inc, dec, etc) not working on string indeces.
+ Added ability to force screen to 32bpp. Fixes some slight rendering
  issues, and if you have problems with fullscreen let me know if this
  helps (try it without first though). See force_32bpp in config.txt.
+ Fixed sprite clipping bug with respect to overlay.
+ Fixed bug where pressing enter on things besides robots, scrolls/signs,
  or sensors in the editor would clear whatever was underneath it.
+ Accidentally broke SFX with optional PC speaker chains (played both,
  should only play PC speaker when digital music is off, fixes Bernard
  the Bard)
+ Made last character in char selection for F3 and alt + C remembered
  (note that they're remembered in two different places for both)
+ Accidentally broke life animations, fixed

November 26, 2005 - MZX 2.81b

+ Fixed inability to make proper .savs of worlds with strings (they'd
  crash when loaded..)
+ Fixed PC speaker audio bug causing a constant high pitched noise to
  be played instead of PC speaker audio sometimes.
+ Fixed some issues with long pathnames.
+ Fixed a bug causing Caverns to crash in recent versions (long story,
  it was most likely due to an error in ver1to2)
+ Now when you set mzx_speed in a game you can no longer change the
  speed from the F2 menu. Setting mzx_speed to 0 reallows this (and
  doesn't set the speed)
+ When loading a game its speed is now set to the speed MZX started
  with (whatever's in config.txt, or the default of 4)
+ Added backup_ext config.txt option to specify the extension of backup
  files (default is .mzx).
+ Fixed backup_interval for config.txt possibly being broken.
+ Fixed a bug messing up the death board on some old MZX games
  (like Nick Brick 2)
+ Escaped more things and made displays always in escaped form for
  certain character sequences. It should be impossible to type
  non-escaped forms. The following should be used:
  \0 for 0 (this probably won't work in strings, but in chars should)
  \t for tab (character 9)
  \n for newline (character 10)
  \r for carriage return (character 13)
  \" for double quote
  \\ for slash
+ Copy + paste on escaped character won't unescape them anymore.
+ Fixed error message for invalid lines in Robotic
+ Fixed inability to import text files from other directories.
+ Huge overhaul of the source (proper types for things, directions,
  equalities, conditions, chest items, and potions), if anything is
  suddenly broken now let me know.
+ Made scrolls/signs only display text (letters, numbers, etc) in the
  default char set. That should be enough for now.
+ Added mousewheel support for robot editor and robot box display.
+ Fixed inability to load MZMs from other directories in the editor.
+ Wrapped audio stuff in proper mutex, hopefully this fixes some issues
  (like crashing when changing mod_frequency a lot).
+ Long current directory paths no longer write out too much in the file
  loader (instead the last bit is shown with a ... prefixing the
  beginning)
+ Decided to be nice and make board_scan not crash. Don't use it. It's
  only there to make one legacy game work. If you use it I will
  personally scold you. And don't tell other people to use it (that
  means you CJA). Use copy block x y w h "$str" t instead. If you don't
  know what that means read the help file, it explains everything.
+ Removed ability to copy + paste after changing board dimensions of the
  source under any circumstances (alt + R, alt + Z, import world, import
  board)
+ Fixed appearance of ghosts in F10 menu.
+ Prevented char editor from counting moving the cursor as an undo step
  if nothing was actually drawn.
+ Made pressing escape on initial char selection/board selection/param
  selection for things cause it to cancel placing anything.
+ Made it impossible to set board width/height to 0 again (oops)
+ Made starting lives and starting health take effect immediately for
  the first alt + t
+ Added ability to play OGG from alt + l (but not the other mods, don't
  want to clutter that up)
+ Made it so if no note follows an embedded SAM in a play string it's
  played at native frequency.
+ Accidentally made loading worlds in the editor not change the current
  directory, fixed that.

November 20, 2005 - MZX 2.81

+ Fixed a bug where MZX world/save names > 12 chars could cause weird
  things to happen (like doors breaking)
+ Fixed problems with helpfile/charsets loading when loading MZX
  outside of the directory MZX is in. This should fix file associations
  on Windows as well.
+ Changed board selector so when board 0 is "(no board)" it doesn't
  actually refer to the title but to no board.
+ Made import world not overwrite the title string.
+ Fixed bug that causes crash when trying to flood fill an area with
  the color it already is in the SMZX char editor.
+ Redid audio engine. Everything is unified now, meaning that anything
  you can use as a mod you can use as a sam and vice-versa.
+ The new audio engine uses its own master resampler that has three
  interpolation modes - see config.txt for more information.
+ sam 0 filename will play a file at its native frequency (note that
  SAMs that have been converted from WAVs are set to be played at
  8363Hz).
+ Added support for OGG vorbis audio files.
+ Fixed bug causing SFX volume control in F2 menu to not work.
+ Removed limitation on number of SAMs that can be played
  simultaneously.
+ Fixed bug where the mouse got "stuck" in the black border edges of
  non 640x350 fullscreen resolutions.
+ Fixed issues with message boxes being part default palette part
  current palette, they now always use the current palette.
+ Added mod_position counter. What these actually set/return is
  dependant on the type of file loaded. Modules use the current row,
  OGGs use the current PCM sample.
+ Added mod_frequency counter. There are a few things to note here:
  Modules have a "nominal" frequency of 44.1KHz. Other data types
  have their own nominal frequency to prevent output from
  sounding differently depending on the audio_sample_rate in config.txt.
  For OGGs and WAVs the nominal frequency is the one the file is
  encoded at.
  Changing the frequency can cause a noticeable one time popping sound,
  so it might not be desirable to slide it. This is much more prominent
  with lowering the frequency than raising it.
  This value is capped so it can't reach below 16.
+ Changed alt + L to play back at natural frequency instead of 8363Hz.
+ Fixed bug causing sensor deletion while the player is on top to
  destroy the player.
+ Fixed bug causing imported boards to possibly crash after being
  tested.
+ Fixed bug causing save_game and save_world to not work if a file
  with the given name isn't already present.
+ Changed function counter matching removing restriction on number of
  digits for parameters. 10+ digit inputs should no longer fail (for
  instance, abs-123456789)
- Save files from 2.80 are not compatible due to several changes in
  the save format.
+ Made counter/string names internally variable length instead of a
  fixed 14 chars. There is now no longer a name length limitation.
+ Changed alt+8 for mod * to just * in the hotkey listing.
+ Fixed crash when referencing (by param) sprites > 256.
+ The string system has been redone. Strings are now dynamically
  sized and don't have an artificial maximum length. Writing to
  string.N will guarantee that the size of the string becomes at
  least N, while reading in this way will return 0 if out of bounds
  to maintain the illusion of null termination. Be careful when using
  this.
+ $str.length returns the length of string $str (this is faster than
  iterating through it to find when chars hit 0)
+ Vlayer is dynamically sized. The vlayer_width/vlayer_height counters
  still work as per usual, but the vlayer_size counter has been added
  to adjust the maximum size. The default is 32768.
+ Fixed bug not allowing things to move over goop.
+ Fixed bugs causing current directory to be changed when importing
  things from other directories.
+ Properly implemented support for volume "string"
+ Fixed a few commands not working when they should from the global
  robot (such as put to dir of player)
+ Fixed a bug where going to a label at the end of a robot would treat
  it as if it's the first of its name in a sequence of labels.
+ Fixed a bug involving moving the a block with the player not moving
  what was underneath the player.
+ New help file, thanks MUCHLY to Terryn for pulling off this enormous
  effort!

June 6, 2005 - MZX 2.80h

+ Fixed a bug which could cause crashes when quiting the game.
+ Fixed some bugs when changing boards and other things that can
  cause duplicate players.. I think.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when adding boards
+ Improved response time in editor for slower computers/high load
  situations
+ Fixed some endian issues with the GUI
+ Fixed some crash when moving the mouse cursor around in the editor
+ Fixed bug where you if you had a robot whose name is the same as
  the global robot it wouldn't get messages (fixes yoyo in Weirdness)
+ Fixed debug box not moving with text input
+ Fixed bug with duplicate player appearing when killed and a new one
  can't be put at 0, 0
+ Added copy/paste for outside of MZX to/from the robot editor. It
  only works in Windows and X11, and functionality may be limited in
  X11 right now (currently seems to work in native X11 apps and
  GTK 2.6 apps but not earlier GTK or QT, also try shift + insert to
  paste)
+ Fixed bug in resizing involving overlay blanking.
+ Fixed clear messages/projectiles not working (and damaging the game
  instead)
+ Fixed behavior of P key in editor for wildweasel.
+ Fixed random in Robotic not correctly swapping the range if they're
  given in the wrong order
+ Fixed clip length in [ messages
+ Fixed crash when changing volume without a game loaded
+ Redid internal GUI system, fixes some minor things
+ New file loading/saving window - press del to delete a file/dir,
  alt + n to create a new directory, alt + r to rename a file/dir.
+ Added PC speaker volume control to F2 settings and config.txt
+ Fixed yet another crash bug with resizing boards
+ Fixed inability to type * in text placement in the editor
  (although this adds inability to turn on mod * while F2 is on...)
+ Added ctrl + n in the editor to load a module for listening only
  (won't set the current board's module, and will let you choose
  ones from different directories)
+ Fixed crash on macros with more variables than can be displayed
  in their configuration.
+ Fixed bug that causes char selection cursor to reset to 0 on
  unhandled keys (and continuously do so for lock keys)
+ Tweaked ctrl + dir in text entry boxes.
+ Added gdm2s3m in-tree to the contrib/ directory. gdm2s3m no longer
  needs to be installed on the system before compiling mzx.
+ Improved the build system to automatically build .c and .cpp files
  with compound system CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, respectively.
+ Made package.sh automatically ship the source package with a
  Makefile.dist to warn the user that they need to run config.sh before
  'make'.
+ Rectified inconsistency in source copyrights.
+ Added multicharacter editor. Select multiple keys in the character
  selection with shift. The char editor also now has the ability to
  perform operations (delete, copy, scroll, etc) on subblocks. Hold
  down shift or press alt + b to highlight a region (press escape to
  remove the latter). Blocks copied like this will be pasted to where
  the cursor is at. Other small things in chareditor tweaked/changed...
  No longer press tab to toggle through set/clear/toggle draw modes,
  instead tab for set mode and shift + tab for clear (no more toggle).
  Mouse behavior is modified as well. In non-SMZX left click sets,
  right click clears. Shift + F2 will cut a block (clear + copy)

  alt + x/alt + i can now be used to import/export partial charsets
  while in the char editor. You can do so for several in series:
  put a # in the name of the charset then set the First for the
  first number # will be replaced with and the Count value to
  indicate how many in series to work with.
  For instance, saving s#.chr with first = 0, count = 3, starting
  at offset 100, with a 2x2 char selection will save charsets
  s0.chr from 100, s1.chr from 104, s2.chr from 108, and
  s3.chr from 112.

  *** NOTE *** Series import/export will only work correctly with
  char selections that are one in height (can still be split up
  another way in the editor itself). So if you want to use
  partial charsets on your edits it's important that you select
  all the chars in a row.

+ Made characters for the editor/GUI use another charset that's
  protected. Please notify me if any characters are incorrect.
  Modify mzx_edit.chr to change this charset.
+ The same thing goes for colors. It doesn't work for SMZX, which
  also might look a bit different in the editor...
+ Added option (defaults on) to protect chars 32-127 in input
  boxes and strings in the robot editor.
+ Mouse warping goes to middle instead of top corner now, so there
  isn't a biased towards moving up.
+ Hopefully fixed another bug with the cursor and changing boards...
+ Fixed module looping problem in modplug...
+ Added libmodplug 0.7 with both patches (see contrib/) in-tree.
  Removes system dependency on libmodplug.
+ Made auto-backup on by default (3 count)
+ Made if touching idle, beneath always false instead of like nodir
+ Fixed bug that caused bad things to happen if you pressed too many
  different keys too rapidly.
+ Made mouse wheel emulate up/down in dialog boxes and list menu.
+ Added ctrl + backspace to intake (delete previous word)
+ Made modulo operator use floored instead of truncated mod (uses
  positive remainder instead of negative)
+ Fixed crash when testing after using ctrl + z to clear a board.
+ Fixed bug where sending other robots to subroutines caused the
  return address to be to the next instruction like local subroutine
  calling works.
+ Fixed bug where going to a label on the last line of the robot could
  screw the game up.
+ Fixed a bug where the editor froze if you tried to fill the board with
  players (eheh...)
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when sending all sensors something.
+ Fixed some crashes when exporting/saving fails.
+ Fixed import world's ability to go over the board limit and cause
  crashes.
+ Allowed input of decimal numbers for params.

April 1, 2005 - MZX 2.80g

+ Fixed crash on alt + x in robot editor.
+ Fixed missing line on alt + h in robot editor.
+ Introduced incorrect enter action in robot editor (didn't reset to beginning
  of the line), fixed.
+ Fixed garbage appearing when moving from a larger to smaller board and being
  outside of that board's scroll region.
+ Fixed bug that could cause glitches/crashing when resizing the board
+ Fixed error with global next option not retaining the three checkmark
  options correctly.
+ Added work around so that move block moves the player (won't move it on
  inter-board moves)
+ Fixed bad palette loading for Linux introduced in 2.80e or f or something
+ Made it so block highlighting doesn't highlight the debug window.
+ Made the debug window move if necessary when home/end is pressed.
+ Added autorepeat buffering so previous keys can be resumed.
+ Fixed bug with swap world possibly not working (crashing??) off Windows
+ Fixed more problems with garbage/crashes when resizing with the cursor
  in a position causing the scroll to go off the edge
+ Fixed incorrect text cursor offset with force_height_multiplier on.
+ Redid way directories are loaded internally so you can load dirs with over
  4096 entries now. Might be faster (unsure)
+ Chest contents list menu looked funny, fixed.
+ Changed default.spl to smzx.pal so you can load it more sanely.
+ Export block wasn't getting the last selected line. Fixed.
+ Hacked scroll editor so it wouldn't crash when removing lines. Scroll code
  either needs to be 100% overhauled or replaced by robots somehow...
+ Fixed config files not being closed.
+ Added include file option for config files. Use it like this:
  include configfile  e.g. include subconfig.cnf will load subconfig.cnf's
  options
+ Fixed freadN not terminating strings.
+ Fixed graphical glitch when using the mouse in the char selector.
+ Fixed save games crashing when they can't load fopened files.
+ Fixed some other problems with save games and fopened files...

  don't end with the )
+ Fixed problem with key_code being triggered for keys that aren't
  in-game

  be entered in the robot editor via a window or by command. See
  macro.txt for more information.
+ Fixed player cloning after flip/mirror and player placing.
+ Added random seeding that was mysteriously missing...
+ Finally added drive changing for Windows builds.
+ Fixed mousex/mousey for resolutions other than 640x350 (only applies to
  fullscreen)
+ Fixed crash on weird invalid death/endgame boards...
+ % and & messages clip correctly now.
+ Fixed potential crash on double closing the files.
+ Fixed crash bugs with placing sensors and maybe scrolls.
+ Fixed sending sensors when you have robots of the same name (fixes
  Weirdness chapter 1)
+ Fixed bug that can screw up your world when placing scrolls or sensors..
  sometimes.

December 26, 2004 - MZX 2.80f

+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when auto-quoting params in the robot
  editor (eg, set x 1 -> set "x" to 1)
+ Fixed a bug that could crash the robot editor if you added a new line prior
  to the first line of a marked block, then did an action on it.
+ Fixed a bug where clearing the first and only line could cause it to appear
  as if it hadn't been cleared at all.
+ Unified global and global next parameter setting so that nothing is lost
  between first/next but information can be cancelled without application.
+ Fixed E/S block markers appearing in the robot editor when they should be
  off the screen.
+ Left click position in robot editor mysteriously disappeared after having
  been added somewhere after 2.80d. Readded.
+ Added option to hide the hotkeys help and horizontal border in the robot
  editor with alt + h. Also added a config.txt option to have it default
  this way.
+ Search/replace in the robot editor. ctrl + f to find or replace/replace all,
  ctrl + r to repeat either search or replace (depending the last one you did,
  if you cancelled this does nothing)
+ The load_game counter sequence was broken; fixed.
+ Hopefully fixed all means of overrunning the current line max length in the
  robot editor...
+ Fixed robot editor validation not showing every 13th line
+ Fixed aesthetic problem with validation report....
+ Fixed crash with setting message column less than 0.
+ A couple things added for 2.80e mysteriously disappeared in source handling.
  Readded.
+ Changed max board size prevention to auto resize the lower dimension to the
  max that can be handled with the higher (ex, 30000x25000 becomes 30000x559)
+ Added floodfill to char editors (alt + f)
+ Added single depth undo to char editors (alt + u)

December 19, 2004 - MZX 2.80e

+ Fixed a bug causing problems with static overlay if a non-overlaid sprite
  is displayed so it's clipped off the edge of the screen.
+ Fixed a bug in the display of c?x color boxes in the F2 menu in the robot
  editor
+ Fixed a bug that caused incorrect thisx/thisy for one cycle after copyblock
+ Fixed a bug preventing calls to nonexistant subroutines from passing that
  point in the robot
+ Fixed crash on sam 0 "file"
+ Fixed a bug where loading new SFX may not correctly overwrite previous ones
+ Fixed a bug where you could only load/unload so many mods before MZX couldn't
  load anymore.. same bug as the SAMs but went unnoticed!
+ Fixed a bug that caused you to be infinitely stuck in the global settings
  dialog box when you press previous on the next page.
+ Fixed a bug where going to next then exiting would not save the changes
  from the previous page.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes while ending modules.
+ Fixed a bug that could do the same kind of thing with sams.
+ Fixed an allocation bug when loading MZX worlds that could lead to crashes.
+ Fixed a bug that caused MZX to crash if you interpolated an expression with
  a value equal to or greater than 1 billion.
+ Fixed a bug where mixing ccheck1/2 with sprites from board and vlayer could
  cause problems (that's the short version of the explanation, I'll spare you
  the long one)
+ Fixed a bug that could cause certain old MZX games to crash after the title
  screen
+ Somewhere broke missiles between 2.80c and 2.80d. Fixed.
+ Fixed error in lit bomb anim sequence setup in char ID editor.
+ Reworked a lot of robot editor code; adding/deleting lines while marked areas
  are active should work more naturally now and it's hopefully no longer possible
  to crash it in the same ways it was previously.
+ Fixed crash when setting mesg row to less than 0.
+ Fixed mouse presses not working in the robot editor.
+ Made MZX ignore alt + tab so you can safely switch in your WM without it
  triggering...
+ Added numerical key entry for number boxes. Use 0-9 to add to the most
  significant digit and backspace to take it away.
- Fixed maximum board size to about 16.7 million tiles (128MB), for now.
+ Added config.txt option to make MZX pause when key focus is lost
  (when clicking on another window, perhaps) or when it's minimized. Music will
  still continue.
+ Added save/load position to the editor. Works for loads inbetween boards as
  well. Press ctrl + num to save to slots 0 through 9 and alt + num to load from
  that slot. Please press shift + 8 or the numpad * key instead of alt + 8 to
  set mod wildcard.
+ MZX now ignores the mouse scroll wheel instead of interpreting it as a click.

+ Added config file option to revert the robot editor to the default palette
  when loaded.

+ Auto-backup - see config.txt for details.
+ Joystick key mapping - see config.txt for details.
+ You can now load game-specific config files by creating game.cnf for the
  corresponding game.cnf (for instance, caverns.cnf). This is mainly useful
  for joystick key mapping. Note that these settings will NOT go away if
  another game is loaded that doesn't have a .cnf.
+ Alt-enter finally works as block action in the robot editor.
+ Loading a .mzx/.sav from another directory indirectly (via command-line or
  robotic) will now actually change the current working directory.
+ Fixed bug that crashed MZX with ctrl + i in the robot editor.

October 9, 2004 - MZX 2.80d

+ Fixed cursor going invisible when escaping from import in the editor
+ Fixed robot editor entry when pressing OK on global info
+ Fixed lack of name for MZB import/export (any MZB's exported in prior
  beta versions still won't have a name)
+ Fixed some problems with setting the mouse position
+ Fixed problem with exits not bringing you all the way to the edge if width
  over 400 or height over 200
+ Fixed bug that cleared too much when increasing both width and height while
  resizing the board
+ Fixed problem with 1 char shortcut commands with spaces immediately after them

+ Cleaned up source code so it passes -Wall without complaint and in the process
  corrected some glaring code errors that may have corrected random problems
+ File opening broken in 2.80c, fixed
+ Implemented MZM2 saving and loading and rewrote mzm.cpp (if anything is changed
  or fixed regarding MZMs, attribute it to this). MZM2s can be of larger
  dimensions, smaller filesize for same amount of data, and can store robots.
+ Fixed bug that could cause MZX to crash when making new strings
+ Block operations to overlay when overlay was off caused crashes - fixed
+ Fixed a problem with sprite ccheck2 against other sprites
+ Optimized function counter lookups a bit; speed gain for all counter accesses
  (especially ones that begin with certain characters such as _)

  was not getting compiled with the dir extension
+ Fixed editor bug where the param was not being cleared when overwriting things
  by double placement
+ Fixed inability to use counters with playercolor/bulletcolor/missilecolor
+ Added ability to use counters in place of p?? in the robot editor
  Note - even though this expands functionality of the editor this does not
  require a version number change because the worlds will still be playable in
  older MZX versions (and will display correctly in the robot editor - you simply
  won't be able to correctly edit the commands)
+ Mouse correctly limited to screen edges now
+ Fixed inability to overwrite robots with pushable robots and vice-versa,
  as well as scrolls with signs and vice-versa
+ Possibly fixed problem with windowing error when editing global robot (?)
+ Fixed disappearing cursor after color selection box with mouse (and other places?)

+ Made board_id/board_param counters readable
+ Added bound checks for all counters using board_x/board_y/overlay_x/overlay_y
+ Removed ability to put robots, scrolls/signs, and sensors (with the put command in
  Robotic)
+ Fixed potential direction corruption bug causing directions not to work
  sometimes even if they display correctly in the robot editor
+ Fixed copy overlay to MZM copying to overlay too
+ Fixed a bug where debug window could display the wrong amount of robot mem
  and potentially even crash MZX
+ Fixed help_menu counter not doing anything (durr)
+ Changed sprite draw order so they're drawn underneath the message bar,
  debug box, and time remaining display
+ Changed put p?? in Robotic so it will put default params if available
+ Fixed a bug that could cause copies from overlay to vlayer to not end up at
  the correct destination
+ Fixed a bug where c?x and cx? would not display correctly in the robot editor
+ Optimized copy blocks a bit using variable length arrays instead of malloc
