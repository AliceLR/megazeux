+ Fixed crash on alt + x in robot editor.
+ Fixed missing line on alt + h in robot editor.
+ Introduced incorrect enter action in robot editor (didn't reset to beginning
  of the line), fixed.
+ Fixed garbage appearing when moving from a larger to smaller board and being
  outside of that board's scroll region.
+ Fixed bug that could cause glitches/crashing when resizing the board
+ Fixed error with global next option not retaining the three checkmark
  options correctly.
+ Added work around so that move block moves the player (won't move it on
  inter-board moves)
+ Fixed bad palette loading for Linux introduced in 2.80e or f or something
+ Made it so block highlighting doesn't highlight the debug window.
+ Made the debug window move if necessary when home/end is pressed.
+ Added autorepeat buffering so previous keys can be resumed.
+ Fixed bug with swap world possibly not working (crashing??) off Windows
+ Fixed more problems with garbage/crashes when resizing with the cursor
  in a position causing the scroll to go off the edge
+ Fixed incorrect text cursor offset with force_height_multiplier on.
+ Redid way directories are loaded internally so you can load dirs with over
  4096 entries now. Might be faster (unsure)
+ Chest contents list menu looked funny, fixed.
+ Changed default.spl to smzx.pal so you can load it more sanely.
+ Export block wasn't getting the last selected line. Fixed.
+ Hacked scroll editor so it wouldn't crash when removing lines. Scroll code
  either needs to be 100% overhauled or replaced by robots somehow...
+ Fixed config files not being closed.
+ Added include file option for config files. Use it like this:
  include configfile  e.g. include subconfig.cnf will load subconfig.cnf's
  options
+ Fixed freadN not terminating strings.
+ Fixed graphical glitch when using the mouse in the char selector.
+ Fixed save games crashing when they can't load fopened files.
+ Fixed some other problems with save games and fopened files...

  don't end with the )
+ Fixed problem with key_code being triggered for keys that aren't
  in-game

  commands from RASM
+ Added extended macros. This allows for parameter based macros to
  be entered in the robot editor via a window or by command. See
  macro.txt for more information.
+ Fixed player cloning after flip/mirror and player placing.
+ Added random seeding that was mysteriously missing...
+ Finally added drive changing for Windows builds.
+ Fixed mousex/mousey for resolutions other than 640x350 (only applies to
  fullscreen)
+ Fixed crash on weird invalid death/endgame boards...
+ % and & messages clip correctly now.
+ Fixed potential crash on double closing the files.
+ Fixed crash bugs with placing sensors and maybe scrolls.
+ Fixed sending sensors when you have robots of the same name (fixes
  Weirdness chapter 1)

December 26, 2004 - MZX 2.80f

+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when auto-quoting params in the robot
  editor (eg, set x 1 -> set "x" to 1)
+ Fixed a bug that could crash the robot editor if you added a new line prior
  to the first line of a marked block, then did an action on it.
+ Fixed a bug where clearing the first and only line could cause it to appear
  as if it hadn't been cleared at all.
+ Unified global and global next parameter setting so that nothing is lost
  between first/next but information can be cancelled without application.
+ Fixed E/S block markers appearing in the robot editor when they should be
  off the screen.
+ Left click position in robot editor mysteriously disappeared after having
  been added somewhere after 2.80d. Readded.
+ Added option to hide the hotkeys help and horizontal border in the robot
  editor with alt + h. Also added a config.txt option to have it default
  this way.
+ Search/replace in the robot editor. ctrl + f to find or replace/replace all,
  ctrl + r to repeat either search or replace (depending the last one you did,
  if you cancelled this does nothing)
+ The load_game counter sequence was broken; fixed.
+ Hopefully fixed all means of overrunning the current line max length in the
  robot editor...
+ Fixed robot editor validation not showing every 13th line
+ Fixed aesthetic problem with validation report....
+ Fixed crash with setting message column less than 0.
+ A couple things added for 2.80e mysteriously disappeared in source handling.
  Readded.
+ Changed max board size prevention to auto resize the lower dimension to the
  max that can be handled with the higher (ex, 30000x25000 becomes 30000x559)
+ Added floodfill to char editors (alt + f)
+ Added single depth undo to char editors (alt + u)

December 19, 2004 - MZX 2.80e

+ Fixed a bug causing problems with static overlay if a non-overlaid sprite
  is displayed so it's clipped off the edge of the screen.
+ Fixed a bug in the display of c?x color boxes in the F2 menu in the robot
  editor
+ Fixed a bug that caused incorrect thisx/thisy for one cycle after copyblock
+ Fixed a bug preventing calls to nonexistant subroutines from passing that
  point in the robot
+ Fixed crash on sam 0 "file"
+ Fixed a bug where loading new SFX may not correctly overwrite previous ones
+ Fixed a bug where you could only load/unload so many mods before MZX couldn't
  load anymore.. same bug as the SAMs but went unnoticed!
+ Fixed a bug that caused you to be infinitely stuck in the global settings
  dialog box when you press previous on the next page.
+ Fixed a bug where going to next then exiting would not save the changes
  from the previous page.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes while ending modules.
+ Fixed a bug that could do the same kind of thing with sams.
+ Fixed an allocation bug when loading MZX worlds that could lead to crashes.
+ Fixed a bug that caused MZX to crash if you interpolated an expression with
  a value equal to or greater than 1 billion.
+ Fixed a bug where mixing ccheck1/2 with sprites from board and vlayer could
  cause problems (that's the short version of the explanation, I'll spare you
  the long one)
+ Fixed a bug that could cause certain old MZX games to crash after the title
  screen
+ Somewhere broke missiles between 2.80c and 2.80d. Fixed.
+ Fixed error in lit bomb anim sequence setup in char ID editor.
+ Reworked a lot of robot editor code; adding/deleting lines while marked areas
  are active should work more naturally now and it's hopefully no longer possible
  to crash it in the same ways it was previously.
+ Fixed crash when setting mesg row to less than 0.
+ Fixed mouse presses not working in the robot editor.
+ Made MZX ignore alt + tab so you can safely switch in your WM without it
  triggering...
+ Added numerical key entry for number boxes. Use 0-9 to add to the most
  significant digit and backspace to take it away.
- Fixed maximum board size to about 16.7 million tiles (128MB), for now.
+ Added config.txt option to make MZX pause when key focus is lost
  (when clicking on another window, perhaps) or when it's minimized. Music will
  still continue.
+ Added save/load position to the editor. Works for loads inbetween boards as
  well. Press ctrl + num to save to slots 0 through 9 and alt + num to load from
  that slot. Please press shift + 8 or the numpad * key instead of alt + 8 to
  set mod wildcard.
+ MZX now ignores the mouse scroll wheel instead of interpreting it as a click.

+ Auto-backup - see config.txt for details.
+ Joystick key mapping - see config.txt for details.
+ You can now load game-specific config files by creating game.cnf for the
  corresponding game.cnf (for instance, caverns.cnf). This is mainly useful
  for joystick key mapping. Note that these settings will NOT go away if
  another game is loaded that doesn't have a .cnf.
+ Alt-enter finally works as block action in the robot editor.
+ Loading a .mzx/.sav from another directory indirectly (via command-line or
  robotic) will now actually change the current working directory.
+ Fixed bug that crashed MZX with ctrl + i in the robot editor.

October 9, 2004 - MZX 2.80d

+ Fixed cursor going invisible when escaping from import in the editor
+ Fixed robot editor entry when pressing OK on global info
+ Fixed lack of name for MZB import/export (any MZB's exported in prior
  beta versions still won't have a name)
+ Fixed some problems with setting the mouse position
+ Fixed problem with exits not bringing you all the way to the edge if width
  over 400 or height over 200
+ Fixed bug that cleared too much when increasing both width and height while
  resizing the board
+ Fixed problem with 1 char shortcut commands with spaces immediately after them
+ Fixed problems with load_robot and load_bc (caused crashes and infinite loops)
+ Optmized RASM heavily (this should be most noticable when doing a lot of
  external robot loading from text files)
+ Fixed inability to use absolute paths in loading a game from command line

+ Cleaned up source code so it passes -Wall without complaint and in the process
  corrected some glaring code errors that may have corrected random problems
+ File opening broken in 2.80c, fixed
+ Implemented MZM2 saving and loading and rewrote mzm.cpp (if anything is changed
  or fixed regarding MZMs, attribute it to this). MZM2s can be of larger
  dimensions, smaller filesize for same amount of data, and can store robots.
+ Fixed bug that could cause MZX to crash when making new strings
+ Block operations to overlay when overlay was off caused crashes - fixed
+ Fixed a problem with sprite ccheck2 against other sprites
+ Optimized function counter lookups a bit; speed gain for all counter accesses
  (especially ones that begin with certain characters such as _)
+ Fixed disassembly error with ' ' character
+ Fixed assembly error where condition extended dir (such as blocked opp seek)
  was not getting compiled with the dir extension
+ Fixed editor bug where the param was not being cleared when overwriting things
  by double placement
+ Fixed inability to use counters with playercolor/bulletcolor/missilecolor
+ Added ability to use counters in place of p?? in the robot editor
  Note - even though this expands functionality of the editor this does not
  require a version number change because the worlds will still be playable in
  older MZX versions (and will display correctly in the robot editor - you simply
  won't be able to correctly edit the commands)
+ Mouse correctly limited to screen edges now
+ Fixed inability to overwrite robots with pushable robots and vice-versa,
  as well as scrolls with signs and vice-versa
+ Possibly fixed problem with windowing error when editing global robot (?)
+ Fixed disappearing cursor after color selection box with mouse (and other places?)
+ Fixed bug in sprite clipping that caused some to be clipped off inappropriately
+ Made board_id/board_param counters readable
+ Added bound checks for all counters using board_x/board_y/overlay_x/overlay_y
+ Removed ability to put robots, scrolls/signs, and sensors (with the put command in
  Robotic)
+ Fixed potential direction corruption bug causing directions not to work
  sometimes even if they display correctly in the robot editor
+ Fixed copy overlay to MZM copying to overlay too
+ Fixed a bug where debug window could display the wrong amount of robot mem
  and potentially even crash MZX
+ Fixed help_menu counter not doing anything (durr)
+ Changed sprite draw order so they're drawn underneath the message bar,
  debug box, and time remaining display
+ Changed put p?? in Robotic so it will put default params if available
+ Fixed a bug that could cause copies from overlay to vlayer to not end up at
  the correct destination
+ Fixed a bug where c?x and cx? would not display correctly in the robot editor
+ Optimized copy blocks a bit using variable length arrays instead of malloc

+ Added clipping for refx/refy/width/height for sprites (less than 0 at
  initialization, greater than board width/height at draw)
+ Fixed direction parsing for move all
+ Fixed bug where creating things on top of the player would use a slot
  for  robots/scrolls/signs/sensors instead of just copy to the buffer

  (ie, set "$str.0" 'a')
+ Added options to enable oversampling and specify resampling mode in
