Direction idiosyncracities:

IDLE counts as walking RANDB if the Robot is not blocked in any cardinal direction.
IDLE counts as walking RANDNB if the Robot is blocked in all cardinal directions.
IDLE Robots are moving CW IDLE, OPP IDLE, RANDP IDLE, and RANDNOT IDLE.
Walking FLOW works for IDLE Robots.
IDLE Robots are not moving CW BENEATH, OPP BENEATH, RANDP BENEATH, or RANDNOT BENEATH.
