MZX REQUESTS:

-Revised help system.[Exo skipped]
-Mouse highlighting of code. Right-click on highlighted code to open block action menu. [Exo skipped]
-Insertion of copy block params in Robotic Editor by visually selecting a block using a hotkey (Robotic editor jumps to a display of the current board, you select an area, and when done the copy block numbers resulting in this are placed in the line of Robotic code).
-Multiple temp slots for characters (currently there is one stored and placed with the char editor's "Copy to buffer" and "Copy from buffer" functions).
-Extended Undo functionality (add ability to undo actions on the board/overlay, increase depth of actions from one).
-An installer.
-Splicing strings via offsetting by negative values. EX: SET "$word" "-ism" || SET "$word+-6" "atropin" || . "* &$word& yields \"atropinism\"" (this is a stupid example; it's far more useful for indexing and reading splices, not writing them)
-Word wrap for the highlighted line.
-Expanded quicksave/load abilities. Quicksave in "slots" determined by going to a menu and picking the active slot. Interval-based quicksaving where one can step backwards through quicksaves.
-Octave range in sound commands increased to 8th octave.
-Enforcement of old-style sound system limitations for pre-port games (i.e. four simultaneous sound effects maximum), to allow overdriven sounds in older games to play as intended. The drawbridge lowering sound sequence in Bernard the Bard is a good example. Version pegged + config file option? Version pegged + F2 menu option?
-Per-pixel camera offset.
-String comparison wildcards or regex support.
-Online support in games, lozl

DEBYTECODE EARLIEST:

-Ability to set individual sound volumes to 0.
-"modname" and "samvolume" counters. (already have mod_name)
-More sound-related control counters (sound/pcfx toggle, volume overall/sound/pcfx). [Exo skipped]
-Mutable length of time message row is active (or even 0 for no expiration).
-Overhaul of recursion. (not sure what the intent here is but having an actual stack would be nice)
-IF command that takes no label (and skips the next line if false). (mandatory 3.01)
-Ability for SFX # to take the long names of SFX lists (e.g. "SFX FullKeys", "SFX Ouch").
-Send All command replaced with special parameter ALL to allow constructs like "send ALL" to send to all targets. (not sure what the intent is here, but agree that this should be a special parameter)
-MOD END WAIT command.
-Ability to quickly restore a Robot's code to what it was before entering the Robot (to allow quick and sane recovery from major flaws like a "replace all" gone bad). (already implemented, but terribly)
-Extension of sound commands to allow loading of music/sound at given volumes.
-Functions.
-Ability to store >80 char board bottom messages and add an adjustable counter for altering the timeout, with 0 for infinite (clear with clear mesg) (version bump). (>80 implemented, adjustable timeout not)
-A subroutine send that stalls the sending Robot until the sent Robot returns.

ALREADY REQUESTED:

-[+Exo, sort of]Methods to jump to a given location on the board (given MZX's boards can now be quite large).
-Looping sound effects independent of the MOD command. [Exo skipped]
-Ability to directly access the vlayer (i.e. through the Editor and not through Robotic commands).
-Analog stick support with MZX (not full analog, just recognition).
-Universal button layouts easily accessible in Robotic (e.g. "Joy1", "Joy2" or "JoyA", "JoyB" counters)
-A platform-neutral onscreen keyboard (for handheld platforms).

NOT QUITE REJECTED:

-Demo format consisting of logged keypresses.
-Extensive manipulation of MZX default text boxes (mutable size, mutable position, more powerful editing of border, images in textbox background, ability to similarly alter remove title bar or remove it entirely, lockable textbox scrolling, ability to change keys to view text/select options/exit textbox).
-Re-addition of mouse editing functionality that the DOS versions had (palette editing, clicking on hotkey text makes hotkey action happen (e.g. clicking on "L:Load" acts as the L key has been pressed), etc.).
-Ability to enter the number lists from CHAR EDIT commands into the character editor to create a character.
-MOD_LENGTH counter (based on current mod row or PCM sample).
-Editing of all bomb anim chars outside of #1 in global's "Edit Chars" menu. (CHAR ID values 169-175).
-Display of "key_pressed", "key_code", "key", "keyn" and "key_release" in the F11 menu, or the debug window.
-A grid of variable size in the board editor.
-Ability for Alt+F to display index # of SFX currently being edited.
-Ability for resolutions to switch to a different number when SMZX modes are triggered.
-Copyrobot-esque command which appends to the end the code of the given Robot to the Robot executing the command instead of replacing the code of the executing Robot altogether. (I want to do this differently somehow--callable functions in other programs?)
-Energizer state with customisable animations/colors.
-Background color fading that ends at a given percentage. (this is already easily doable in robotic)
-Removal of fade transitions when loading a game for testing. (what? why?)
-Loading of compressed files, most notably MZMs. (could be useful, but would require an alternate/parallel MZM format because of MZM forward compatability)
-Zoom.

REJECTED:

-Edit" button on world loader window (i.e. the one which MZX displays on open unless a default world is loaded as per config.txt) [Exo skipped]
-Ability to add color codes relevant to message commands when pressing F2 (*, &, %, ?, and so on). [Exo skipped]
-Ability to retain cursor/board positions after leaving the world.
-Auto-hide mouse cursor in editor after a certain period of mouse disuse. [Exo skipped]
-Ability to reference sprites from the overlay.
-SMZX mode with full resolution but where two characters act as a single character.
-Ability to prompt default save/load menus via Robotic. [Exo skipped]
-Read-only viewport height and viewport width characters. [Exo skipped]
-Making charcters 16x14 to allow ability to have 8x14 chars with 4 colors/char in SMZX modes. Uses 512-chars per charset, and all of the 256 colors set to a pre-defined palette rather than mathematically.
-Pixel-accurate block copy with scaling.
-MIDI.
-A SMALLHACKER COUNTER

ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:

-[+Exo]Ability to re-order boards. (M)
-Ability to remove "edges" from characters. (unbound sprites)
-Listing of number of commands executed last cycle in F11 debug. (mostly already implemented)
-Hotkeys to instantly jump to the next and previous boards. [Exo skipped] (+-)
-[+Terryn]Board setting to toggle freezing the player when spacebar is held down (on by default). (spacelock, is global)
-Charsets/palettes bound to the current board via displaying in the editor. (in runtime; planned editor extension)
-Per-pixel sprite locations.
-Separate font characters from normal chars.
-Hardier F11 menu (stronger name seeks, ability to set new counters/strings, ability to see/manip local counters (in Rn.<counter> format)). (did this differently)
-Different built-in color for comments in the Robotic Editor. (debytecode)
-Program title bar listing current MZX world open and current board name.
-board_editor_hide_help to still display current item in buffer and editor mode.
-Ability to halt a loop which doesn't end a cycle.
-Support for more mouse buttons and the scrollwheel (forward-back button support minimum).
-Changing sprite cx/cy values into signed ints as opposed to signed bytes.
