MZX REQUESTS:

-Revised help system.[Exo skipped]
-Edit" button on world loader window (i.e. the one which MZX displays on open unless a default world is loaded as per config.txt) [Exo skipped]
-[+Exo, sort of]Methods to jump to a given location on the board (given MZX's boards can now be quite large).
-Mouse highlighting of code. Right-click on highlighted code to open block action menu. [Exo skipped]
-Demo format consisting of logged keypresses.
-Visible vlayer, able to be placed over or under the overlay.
-Extensive manipulation of MZX default text boxes (mutable size, mutable position, more powerful editing of border, images in textbox background, ability to similarly alter remove title bar or remove it entirely, lockable textbox scrolling, ability to change keys to view text/select options/exit textbox).
-Insertion of copy block params in Robotic Editor by visually selecting a block using a hotkey (Robotic editor jumps to a display of the current board, you select an area, and when done the copy block numbers resulting in this are placed in the line of Robotic code).
-Ability to add color codes relevant to message commands when pressing F2 (*, &, %, ?, and so on). [Exo skipped]
-Multiple temp slots for characters (currently there is one stored and placed with the char editor's "Copy to buffer" and "Copy from buffer" functions).
-Extended Undo functionality (add ability to undo actions on the board/overlay, increase depth of actions from one).
-Analog stick support with MZX (not full analog, just recognition).
-Ability to retain cursor/board positions after leaving the world.
-More sound-related control counters (sound/pcfx toggle, volume overall/sound/pcfx). [Exo skipped]
-Auto-hide mouse cursor in editor after a certain period of mouse disuse. [Exo skipped]
-Ability to reference sprites from the overlay.
-Ability to directly access the vlayer (i.e. through the Editor and not through Robotic commands).
-[+Exo]Ability to re-order boards.
-Re-addition of mouse editing functionality that the DOS versions had (palette editing, clicking on hotkey text makes hotkey action happen (e.g. clicking on "L:Load" acts as the L key has been pressed), etc.).
-SMZX mode with full resolution but where two characters act as a single character.
-Ability to enter the number lists from CHAR EDIT commands into the character editor to create a character.
-Ability to remove "edges" from characters.
-An installer.
-Ability to prompt default save/load menus via Robotic. [Exo skipped]
-Listing of number of commands executed last cycle in F11 debug.
-Looping sound effects independent of the MOD command. [Exo skipped]
-Read-only viewport height and viewport width characters. [Exo skipped]
-Hotkeys to instantly jump to the next and previous boards. [Exo skipped]
-[+Terryn]Board setting to toggle freezing the player when spacebar is held down (on by default).
-MOD_LENGTH counter (based on current mod row or PCM sample).
-Charsets/palettes bound to the current board via displaying in the editor.
-Editing of all bomb anim chars outside of #1 in global's "Edit Chars" menu. (CHAR ID values 169-175).
-Display of "key_pressed", "key_code", "key", "keyn" and "key_release" in the F11 menu, or the debug window.
-Mutable length of time message row is active (or even 0 for no expiration).
-Zoom.
-Per-pixel camera offset.
-Overhaul of recursion.
-Per-pixel sprite locations.
-A grid of variable size in the board editor.
-Splicing strings via offsetting by negative values. EX: SET "$word" "-ism" || SET "$word+-6" "atropin" || . "* &$word& yields \"atropinism\""
-Universal button layouts easily accessible in Robotic (e.g. "Joy1", "Joy2" or "JoyA", "JoyB" counters)
-IF command that takes no label (and skips the next line if false).
-Separate font characters from normal chars.
-Ability to set individual sound volumes to 0.
-"modname" and "samvolume" counters.
-Hardier F11 menu (stronger name seeks, ability to set new counters/strings, ability to see/manip local counters (in Rn.<counter> format)).
-Ability for Alt+F to display index # of SFX currently being edited.
-Ability for SFX # to take the long names of SFX lists (e.g. "SFX FullKeys", "SFX Ouch").
-Different built-in color for comments in the Robotic Editor.
-Send All command replaced with special parameter ALL to allow constructs like "send ALL" to send to all targets.
-Ability for resolutions to switch to a different number when SMZX modes are triggered.
-Making charcters 16x14 to allow ability to have 8x14 chars with 4 colors/char in SMZX modes. Uses 512-chars per charset, and all of the 256 colors set to a pre-defined palette rather than mathematically.
-Word wrap for the highlighted line.
-Program title bar listing current MZX world open and current board name.
-Copyrobot-esque command which appends to the end the code of the given Robot to the Robot executing the command instead of replacing the code of the executing Robot altogether.
-MOD END WAIT command.
-Expanded quicksave/load abilities. Quicksave in "slots" determined by going to a menu and picking the active slot. Interval-based quicksaving where one can step backwards through quicksaves.
-A platform-neutral onscreen keyboard (for handheld platforms).
-Pixel-accurate block copy with scaling.
-board_editor_hide_help to still display current item in buffer and editor mode.
-Ability to quickly restore a Robot's code to what it was before entering the Robot (to allow quick and sane recovery from major flaws like a "replace all" gone bad).
-Octave range in sound commands increased to 8th octave.
-Energizer state with customisable animations/colors.
-Ability to halt a loop which doesn't end a cycle.
-Extension of sound commands to allow loading of music/sound at given volumes.
-Support for more mouse buttons and the scrollwheel (forward-back button support minimum).
-Enforcement of old-style sound system limitations for pre-port games (i.e. four simultaneous sound effects maximum), to allow overdriven sounds in older games to play as intended. The drawbridge lowering sound sequence in Bernard the Bard is a good example. Version pegged + config file option? Version pegged + F2 menu option?
-Background color fading that ends at a given percentage.
-Functions.
-Ability to store >80 char board bottom messages and add an adjustable counter for altering the timeout, with 0 for infinite (clear with clear mesg) (version bump).
-MIDI.
-Changing sprite cx/cy values into signed ints as opposed to signed bytes.
-A subroutine send that stalls the sending Robot until the sent Robot returns.
-Removal of fade transitions when loading a game for testing.
-Loading of compressed files, most notably MZMs.
-String comparison wildcards or regex support.
-Online support in games, lozl
-A SMALLHACKER COUNTER
