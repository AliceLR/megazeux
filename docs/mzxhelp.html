Using MegaZeux's help system is very simple. Press F1 at almost
any time to bring up context-relevant help. Within help, use the
arrow keys to scroll the current section. Press PageUp and
PageDown to scroll faster. Many sections of help contain
selections, like this:

<a class="helplink" href="#HELPONHE.HLP__sl">Selection</a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="HELPONHE.HLP__sl"> </a>
Scroll the section until the pointer is aligned with the arrows
on the edges of the help box, and press Enter. You will jump to
a help section indicated by the selection. Example: If a
selection says "Controls", scroll until the word is aligned
with the arrows on the left and right, and press Enter. You
should now be reading help on Controls.

Press F1 within help to jump to this section. Press Alt+F1
within help to jump to the Table of Contents (Table of Major
Help Topics). Press ESC to exit the help system.

As you may already know, MegaZeux is a game system which
allows you to play almost limitless worlds with
dated-yet-charming graphics and with excellent digitized music
and sound. Not only are there several MZX worlds out there
already, but new worlds are being uploaded to large websites
like DigitalMZX. However, the best feature of MegaZeux is the
World Editor.

Using the World Editor, ANYONE can create the world of their
dreams. Make it as simple or complex (well, almost), as easy
or difficult, as long or short as you please. We aren't just
talking about worlds made up of petty, pre-programmed enemies
and objects; MegaZeux has its own, easy-to-use PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE called Robotic that allows you to create objects,
engines and worlds that do almost anything you desire. Not only
can you make your own game with the editor, but every world
MegaZeux can play can be opened in the editor. Take a look at
how other games tick!

For the newest user, it's recommended that you play Caverns,
the first ever MegaZeux game, to get the feel of simple yet
well-designed games in MegaZeux. You may wish to read the help
section entitled "Controls" to learn how to play MegaZeux.

If you're more adventurous, start with a more complex game like
Demon Earth or Bernard the Bard, or a prettier game like & or
Fritz Blitz to see what kind of graphics functions, bells and
whistles MZX can offer.

Once you have the feel for the game, feel free to dive into the
World Editor and get messy! You should probably read the help
section entitled "The World Editor" first.

To go to one of these sections now, hit Enter after aligning
the arrows with one of these choices. Press ESC now to exit to
the game.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">A ZZTer's Guide to MegaZeux</span></p>
ZZT and MegaZeux are worlds apart, although one can convert
from making ZZT games to making basic MegaZeux games with
(mostly) minimal effort. This section is to help seasoned
ZZTers adjust to MegaZeux.

Firstly, some mechanistic differences exist.

-MegaZeux uses counters instead of flags; however, counters
can easily be used as flags if set only to 1 and 0.
-MegaZeux has an incredibly high amount of available counters.
-There is no default mechanism for torches.
-No equivalent of centipedes exists as a default enemy.
-Multiple MegaZeux keys of the same color can be picked up at
 once.
-There is no board setting controlling the amount of player
shots that can be on a given board, outside of preventing the
player from shooting altogether.
-Cloning the player has no use in MZX; uses of player clones
need simulated in Robotic.
-The Shift-? hotkey (often used for inventory engines) does not
exist in MegaZeux but can be emulated with Robotic.
-ZZT prevents moving between boards if the other board has an
object where the player would end up, but MZX simply overwrites
the object on the other board with the player.
-Bomb explosions are not instantaneous but instead radiate out
from the center. They are also diamond-shaped as opposed to
a flattened oval shape and do not ignore walls.
-MegaZeux uses cycle 1 as default (as opposed to ZZT's cycle
3).
-No equivalent of duplicators exists.
-Seekers (aka "stars") and bears do not destroy Breakaway
territories in MegaZeux.
-MegaZeux water is not equivalent to ZZT water, as it can be
traversed. ZZT water is most similar to MZX's "goop".
-MZX Sharks can be shot. They do not swim in water, but can in
lava or goop. They can also shoot any type of projectile.
-MZX Scrolls cannot execute code. Use a Robot ending with the
"die" command to emulate ZZT scrolls with code instead.
-Terrains that give out a distinctive message on first touch
(fakes, forests) give out no such message in MZX.
-There are two types of Gems; the one that best emulates ZZT
gems is the Magic Gem.
-Lasers will not push the player into other objects. This makes
some ZZT laser configurations a lot less deadly.
-Scrolls with only one line launch a message box (instead of
using the message line for the line).
-ZZT has one less bullet type than MZX; shift MZX types one
tier of "friendliness" for each typical shooter to get
ZZT-equivalent bullets.
-Putting in fake commands for comedic effect (e.g. putting in 
<span class="fA ">#GOSUCKANEGG</span><span class="fF "> to make ZZT beep and go "ERR: Bad command</span>
GOSUCKANEGG") does not work in MegaZeux and has to be emulated.
-Special exploits (e.g. black holes, monitors, speed-up
exploit, flag overloading) have no direct MZX equivalent.
-Other, extremely minor, differences best left for total wonks
or for ZZT port authors, while others are implicitly understood
and do not require spelling out.

Secondly, here is how the ZZT-OOP commands convert to Robotic.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Key:

[*] = There's no direct (i.e. one-line) way to make Robots do
commands on IF statements. A label pointing to the command will
have to do.

[+] = There is no good analogue for this command, due to
bound objects sharing zap/restore settings in ZZT. Without
these concerns, COPYROBOT is the closest match. Also, ZZT
objects using BIND use only as much memory as the object had
before in ZZT, while Robots using COPYROBOT will use as much
memory as the target Robot once copied.

[#] = You need to manually add a label at the top of the Robot
for this in MZX.

---------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="fA ">@object_name = . "@Robot_name"</span>

<span class="fA ">/direction/direction = PERSISTENT GO (works only for cardinal</span>
<span class="fA ">directions and idle: n s e w i)</span>

<span class="fA ">?direction = / "directions"</span>

<span class="fA ">'comment = . "comment"</span>

<span class="fA ">one line of text = * "text"</span>

<span class="fA ">multiple lines of text = % "text"</span>

<span class="fA ">!label;text = ? "label" "text"</span>

<span class="fA ">$ text = % "~ftext" (by default palette)</span>

<span class="fA ">#BECOME thing = BECOME color thing param</span>

<span class="fA ">#BIND object_name = COPYROBOT "Robot" [+]</span>

<span class="fA ">#CHANGE thing newthing = CHANGE color thing param newcolor</span>
<span class="fA ">newthing newparam</span>

<span class="fA ">#CHAR # = CHAR #</span>

<span class="fA ">#CLEAR flag = SET "counter" 0</span>

<span class="fA ">#CYCLE # = CYCLE #</span>

<span class="fA ">#DIE = DIE</span>

<span class="fA ">#END = END</span>

<span class="fA ">#ENDGAME = ENDGAME</span>

<span class="fA ">#GIVE item # = GIVE # item</span>

<span class="fA ">#GO direction = GO direction #</span>

<span class="fA ">#IDLE = WAIT #</span>

<span class="fA ">#IF flag label;text = ? "counter" "label" "text"</span>

<span class="fA ">#IF flag THEN command = IF "counter" = 1 THEN "label" </span>
<span class="fF ">[*]</span>

<span class="fA ">#IF ANY object THEN command = IF ANY color thing param "label"</span>
<span class="fF ">[*]</span>

<span class="fA ">#IF NOT flag THEN command = IF "counter" = 0 THEN "label" </span>
<span class="fF ">[*]</span>

<span class="fA ">#IF condition THEN command = IF condition THEN "label" </span>
<span class="fF ">[*]</span>

<span class="fA ">#IF NOT condition THEN command = IF NOT condition THEN "label"</span>
<span class="fF ">[*]</span>

<span class="fA ">#LOCK = LOCKSELF</span>

<span class="fA ">#PLAY notes = PLAY "notes"</span>

<span class="fA ">#PUT direction thing = PUT color thing param direction</span>

<span class="fA ">#RESTART </span>
<span class="fF ">[#]</span>

<span class="fA ">#RESTORE label = RESTORE "label" #</span>

<span class="fA ">#SEND label = GOTO "label"</span>

<span class="fA ">#SEND Objectname:"label" = SEND "Robotname" "label"</span>

<span class="fA ">#SEND ALL:command = SEND "All" "label" </span>
<span class="fF ">[*]</span>

<span class="fA ">#SET flag = SET "counter" 1</span>

<span class="fA ">#SHOOT direction = SHOOT direction</span>

<span class="fA ">#TAKE item # failure_label = TAKE # item "failure_label"</span>
<span class="fA ">(failure label optional)</span>

<span class="fA ">#THROWSTAR direction = SHOOTSEEKER direction</span>

<span class="fA ">#TRY direction label = TRY direction "label"</span>

<span class="fA ">#UNLOCK = UNLOCKSELF</span>

<span class="fA ">#WALK direction = WALK direction</span>

<span class="fA ">#ZAP label = ZAP "label" #</span>

---------------------------------------------------------------

As for conditions, a few are changed:

<span class="fA ">ALLIGNED</span><span class="fF "> is now </span><span class="fA ">ALIGNED</span>

<span class="fA ">CONTACT</span><span class="fF "> is now </span><span class="fA ">TOUCHING ANYDIR</span>

<span class="fA ">ENERGIZED</span><span class="fF "> is no longer a condition but the "invinco" label.</span>

---------------------------------------------------------------

This should be all one needs to make most ZZT-style games for
MegaZeux, except for a little Robotic knowledge to replicate
things like torches and duplicators. Of course, much more
powerful games can be made with MegaZeux; see corresponding
help for details.

<div class="helpfile" id="DIABOX.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="DIABOX.HLP__098"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Dialog Boxes</span></p>
Much of MegaZeux's interface is made of dialog boxes. They
are simple and intuitive to use, but instructions for the
uninformed are included here.

A dialog box is a form of inputting various information. An
example of a dialog box is the Save Game box or the Settings
box, both in-game. To use a box is simple - Use TAB and
SHIFT+TAB to highlight an element, and type or use the cursor
keys to change the value. Press ENTER on a button (Rectangle
with a label) to exit the dialog or produce an effect.

MZX also utilizes mouse control. You can click on a dialog box
element to select it, or click on a selected element to change
it. The mouse wheel will cycle up/down the choices in the
current section. Click on a selected button to activate it.

You can usually use HOME to jump to the first section of the
dialog box, and END to jump to the OK or NEXT button. TAB jumps
forward a section, while SHIFT+TAB goes backwards a section.

The different dialog box elements and special related keys
are explained in detail for the remainder of this section.

INPUT - This is where you type in a series of characters,
usually letters and numbers. You can move the cursor around
within the line, type to insert characters, move to the start
with Home, and move to the end with End. Alt + Backspace
deletes the entire line, while Ctrl + Backspace deletes the
last typed word.

NUMBER - This is where you have a number and you change it
with the arrow keys or mouse clicks on buttons. Up, Down, and
the mouse wheel will change it by 1, Alt+Up, Alt+Down and
Alt+Wheel will change it by 10, and PageUp and PageDown will
change it by 100. You can also hold the mouse button down on one
of the arrows to change the number or press 0-9 to set the last
digit. Pressing 0-9 on the keypad changes the current digit to
that value. Finally, Backspace deletes the last digit.

NUMBER LINE - This is a line of numbers, with one highlighted.
It functions in a manner similar to the above, but in a limited
range.

CHARACTER - This is where you can select characters. Press a
character to use that character; click on it or press Enter to
get a large menu of characters (32x8) to select from.

COLOR - This is where you can select a single color. Press
Enter or click on it to get a large menu of colors to choose
from.

CHECK BOXES - These are On/Off switches. Use Up/Down or the
mouse wheel to move within the list of choices, and use Space,
Enter, or mouse clicks to toggle choices on and off. Press Tab
to jump out of a check box section. An [X] means the option is
currently on.

RADIO BUTTONS - These are similar to Check Boxes, but are
mutually exclusive. The mouse or arrow keys will select the
current and ONLY option that is on. The ( ) shows the current
option.

BUTTON - These are rectangles with labels. When selected,
press Enter or click to activate. OK or Done will verify the
contents of the dialog box. Cancel will cancel any changes
you've made. (ESC will usually do this as well.) Next and
Previous move between multiple dialog boxes. Other buttons
do what their label signifies and are explained in the
appropriate help section.

LISTS - These show a selection from a list of choices. The
current selection is shown. Press Enter or click on it to
bring up a list of choices from which you can select a new
choice.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<hr /></div>

<div class="helpfile" id="CONTROLS.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="CONTROLS.HLP__ctr"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Controls</span></p>
Universal controls are as follows:

-Tab goes forward one section; Shift+Tab goes backward one
section.

-Esc cancels.

-Enter selects.

-Alt+Backspace deletes the entire line.

-Ctrl+Backspace deletes the last typed word.

-Ctrl+Left jumps to the previous word; Ctrl+Right jumps to the
next word.

-0 thru 9 sets the last digit in a number box (such as setting
amounts of items in a chest); backspace deletes the last digit.

On Mac platforms, any command that uses the Alt key can take &#xE0BD;&#xE0BE;
(the command key) instead.

File access controls are as follows:

-(0-9 and A-Z) will jump to the first file/directory starting
with that character. More specific seeking can be done by
typing characters in quick succession (for instance, s+e+c
would jump to the first file starting with sec).

-Del will delete the highlighted file/directory. You will be
asked for confirmation.

-Alt+R will rename the highlighted file/directory.

-Alt+N will create a new directory.

In-game controls are as follows:

F1 - Help
Use this at any time to bring up context-relevant help. Within
the game, you will go to the Controls section. Some games may
have this menu disabled or replaced with their own help menus.

Enter - Menu/Status
Use this to bring up a menu of options and a list of your
current stats, such as Score, Gems, any custom-defined status
counters, etc. Some games may have this key do nothing, or even
something different entirely. Clicking on the key shortcuts
(everything but move/shoot/bomb) will perform the given action.

Certain key shortcuts will not be listed if the current MZX
world prevents their default actions from happening. "Help",
"Save game", "Restore game", "Quicksave" and "Quickload" can be
filtered out this way, while "Exit to title" and "Settings" are
always available and still work when clicked even if otherwise
locked out.

ESC - Exit to Title
This will load a prompt to quit the current game and return to
its title screen. In yes/no dialog boxes, this selects the "no"
option. Some games may disable using ESC to trigger the exit
prompt, but other methods (such as Alt+F4 or clicking on the
"ESC - Exit to Title" text in the Enter menu) will always work.

F2 or Ctrl+F2 or Alt+F2 - Settings
<a class="helpanchor" name="CONTROLS.HLP__092">This will bring up a dialog box where you can change the</a>
current game settings: Game Speed (if allowed), Music/sample SFX
toggle, PC speaker SFX toggle, and Audio Volumes (Music,
Samples, and PC Speaker).

Speed 1 is the fastest; speed 16 is the slowest. A speed of 1
will run MZX as fast as possible and as such acts differently
between computers; it will also cause flicker in fullscreen
mode, so it is not recommended unless it is your only option.
(Please note that some games may have the speed change by
itself and/or enforce a set speed.)

No changes to sound options will go into effect until the
Settings menu is left.

In addition to these settings, one can change the current
renderer with the "Select renderer..." button, and can change
the scaling shader if running MegaZeux with the GLSL or
auto_GLSL renderers.

Settings for game speed will only apply for the current world;
all other settings are global.

Note that some games may block access to the F2 menu entirely.
Ctrl+F2 or Alt+F2 will ignore this setting and allow access to
the menu even if it is prohibited otherwise, as will clicking
on the "F2 - Settings" text in the Enter menu.

F3 - Save Game
This will prompt you for a filename, allowing the saving of the
exact state of the current game. Some games may not allow
saving on some (or any) of its screens, or will only allow
saving in certain spots of a board. Saving lets you quit your
game in the middle or take precautions against unknown dangers.

F4 - Restore Game
This will let you select a saved game from a list of filenames.
The game will then be reloaded from the same point you left
off. While most games will allow loading anywhere, some will
restrict loading to certain times or will use a custom
mechanism for loading games instead. In general, MegaZeux can
only load saves made in MegaZeux versions sharing the current
version number (e.g. 2.81c can load saves made in 2.81 through
2.81h), but current versions of MegaZeux allow direct loading of
saves made in 2.84 versions as well as saves made in the current
version.

NOTE: A few games may save or load automatically, and
high-caliber games may have completely different methods of
saving and loading games.

F5 or Ins - Toggle Bomb Type
This will switch your current bomb type between High Strength
and Low Strength.

F6 - Debug Window
This will bring up a small box in the lower left corner of the
screen, detailing several statistics. The top-right of the box
displays the world version of the current world; X/Y lists the
current x,y position of the player; Board lists the current
board number; Robot mem lists the amount of Robot memory
currently consumed by the current board's Robots; the space
below lists the currently playing music, with "(no module)" for
none and "*" for the module wildcard; finally, the bottom right
numbers list the key_code (green) and key_pressed (magenta)
values of the last pressed key. Press F6 again to turn the box
off. This shortcut will only work during playtesting in the
editor.

F7 - Items Cheat

This will set ammo, coins, gems, hibombs and lobombs to 32767,
fill health (set to maxhealth), fill lives (set to maxlives),
and set keys to one of each color. This is a cheating function,
so do not use unless fully necessary; a few games punish the
player for using this function. This may be limited to
playtesting sessions in the editor, or limited to MZXRun builds,
depending on config.txt settings.

F8 - Zap Cheat

This will destroy everything in all eight directions directly
around the player, replacing all eight squares with spaces.
This is a cheating function, so do not use unless fully
necessary; a few games punish the player for using this
function. This may be limited to playtesting sessions in the
editor, or limited to MZXRun builds, depending on config.txt
settings.

F9 - Quicksave
This will save the game, like F3, but will automatically save to
the last filename you used. The old file will be overwritten. If
no game has been saved since MegaZeux was started, the save will
have the default filename listed in the config.txt file. If
saving is blocked, quicksaving will be blocked as well.

<a class="helplink" href="#CONFGINI.HLP__1st">The Config File</a>

F10 - Quickload
This will load the last save that was saved with F3 or F9. If no
game has been saved since MegaZeux was started, the default save
filename will be used. The same caveats about save versions
still apply here. If loading is blocked, quickloading will be
blocked as well.

F11 - Counter Debug Mode
This will load a screen listing which counters and strings
have been set, as well as values for default counters and
strings. Counter debug mode allows considerable manipulation of
counters and strings, among other things. This shortcut only
works when playtesting in the editor. For more detail, go to its
specific section.

<a class="helplink" href="#DBGMODE.HLP__100">Debug Modes - Counter Debug Mode</a>

Alt+F11 - Robotic Debugger
This will launch the config menu for the built-in Robotic
debugger. The Robotic debugger can monitor running Robotic code
and allow step-by-step reading and manipulation of running
Robots as they execute. This shortcut only works when
playtesting in the editor. For more detail, go to its specific
section.

<a class="helplink" href="#DBGMODE.HLP__101">Debug Modes - The Robotic Debugger</a>

F12 - Take Screenshot
Pressing F12 will make a 640x350 screenshot (in PNG format by
default) in the working directory, using the software renderer.
The file naming starts from "screen0". The config file may
disallow taking screenshots, depending on setting.

Arrows - Move
The arrow keys will move the player and allow it to interact
with most objects in most games.

Space - Shoot
By default, one uses this key in conjunction with an arrow
key to fire a weapon in the selected direction. Weapons and
spacebar uses vary from world to world.

Del - Bomb
By default, this will drop a bomb of the current type BENEATH
the player. Move out of the way to activate it, then run before
it explodes! Uses of the del key vary from game to game.

Tab / Left Arrow / Right Arrow - Select Option
In yes/no dialog boxes, these keys toggle between yes and no.

Other games may have other controls, such as 'S' to cast a
spell or 'I' to bring up an inventory screen, but they should be
detailed within the game.

The following keys are active at the title screen:

F1 - Help (see above)

Enter - Menu
This is similar to default Enter within the game. However,
it brings up a list of key bindings instead.

ESC - Exit MegaZeux
Pressing ESC will load a prompt where the user can exit
MegaZeux.

F2 / Ctrl+F2 / Alt+F2 / S - Settings (see above)

F3 or L - Load World
This will allow you to load up the title screen of any MegaZeux
world. A list of choices will be presented to you to select
from. After the world is loaded, you may watch the title
screen, then press 'P' to play.

F4 or R - Restore Game (see above)

F5 or P - Play Game
This will stop the title screen and actually begin game play.

F7 or U - Updater
This will load the updater. The updater will connect to an
online repository and check if a new MegaZeux version is
available. If so, the user gets the option to update MegaZeux.
MZX will then list the files added/changed/deleted in the
update, and if the user decides to update, MZX will restart
when the update is finished.
WARNING: This will most likely replace your config.txt file, so
if you want to keep your settings, make a backup first so you
can apply your settings to the new file!

F8 or N - New World
This will quit the gaming portion of MegaZeux and enter the
integrated World Editor, set to an empty MZX world. Alt+N will
act the same, but skip the prompt to name and create a starting
board.

F9 or E - Edit World
This will quit the gaming portion of MegaZeux and enter the
integrated World Editor, set to edit the currently-loaded
world. When no world is loaded, this acts the same as New World,
and Alt+E with no world loaded will also skip the prompt to name
and create a starting board. Note that "MZXRun" builds of
MegaZeux do not contain the editor. For detailed info on using
the World Editor, view the appropriate help sections.

<a class="helpanchor" name="NONDESCR.HLP__091"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Nondescript Play Tips</span></p>
First, let me warn you that many worlds you get from archives
or (especially) from personal webpages may not be of acceptable
quality. They may be unfair, boring, have numerous bugs, and/or
not give proper instructions. On a related note, PLEASE try to
get feedback and try acting on it before uploading your game,
even in these days where games are fewer and farther between.
Really old games of bad quality, on the other hand, are
tolerated somewhat better. Don't let a few dull games ruin the
fun.

With that out of the way, some basic play tips:

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> RTFM (Read the Flipping Manual). Whatever information</span>
 the game has to give is probably important. Some authors
 include info files in their distributions; make sure these
 are read. It saves everybody time and effort. To authors, it
 saves time and effort to include such files in your
 submissions.

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Make sure you visit every screen possible.</span>

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Save your game! It is rather simple - in most games,</span>
 Press F3 to save your game to disk at the EXACT point you are
 [if allowed]. Press F4 to reload a saved game. You can use F9
 and F10 to quick-save and quick-load, which work on the last
 game you saved. Remember to save often and keep multiple saves-
 If something ends your game, you'll want to lose as little
 progress as possible.
 
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Touch everything! Even things of seemingly little value</span>
 may prove worthy of your attention. If it kills you, then...
 well... hope you saved (see above).

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Collect supplies! Make sure you grab every coin, gem,</span>
 ammo dump, bomb, chest, pouch, and foobar you see! You will
 often be in want of supplies, so don't push things.

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Remember how things work. Most things in MegaZeux have</span>
 patterns, even Robots, and the same object will usually do the
 same thing all the time. (However, two objects may look alike
 and not really be the same thing.)

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Don't take anything for granted. If it looks like a spike,</span>
 it probably is. _Probably_. Although it is rare that these
 types of puzzles must be solved to complete a game, there
 are often bonuses, hidden rooms, etc. behind illusions.

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Try things twice, even thrice. Sometimes objects respond</span>
 differently at other times. If you get a new treasure, go
 talk to all the citizens - maybe one of them will say
 something new. If some place seems inaccessible, come back
 later!

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> If doing the same thing over and over keeps failing, try</span>
 something else. It helps to look at new methods and to put
 distance between yourself and the problem.
 
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> Bullets can stop spitting fire, but only sometimes. If trying</span>
 to gun down an enemy that spits fire, stagger your shots
 somewhat; holding down the spacebar often results in ALL of
 your shots being cancelled.

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF "> If all else fails, look in the game with the editor. This</span>
 depends on the clarity of the author(s)'s code, but looking in
 the editor can help if all other solutions have been
 exhausted.

<a class="helpanchor" name="MOUSESUP.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Mouse Support in MegaZeux</span></p>
Use of the mouse is very simple. Move the mouse to move the
mouse cursor. Press the Left mouse button to select something,
activate something, etc. Press the Right mouse button to grab
whatever's under the cursor in the World Editor. Certain games
may make use of the mouse during gameplay; the scroll wheel will
always emulate up/down presses in dialog boxes and the list menu
on top of whatever functions it may have in the current game.

<a class="helpanchor" name="BUILTINS.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Mirth of Built-ins</span></p>
The following help section contains a list of the different
objects, enemies, items, and terrains you will find within
the different MegaZeux worlds.
Want to make a (very) quick and (very) dirty game? Built-ins are
the way to do it! However, outside of a select few built-ins
(such as certain terrains, Robots and items) heavy usage of
these built-ins for long-term projects is best-suited for
beginners and savants.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Terrains</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
<span class="fB ">Space</span>

This is the simplest terrain; it does absolutely nothing!

<span class="fB ">Normal         </span><span class="fA b0 ">&#xE0B2;</span>
<span class="fB ">Solid          </span><span class="fE ">&#xE0DB;</span>
<span class="fB ">Tree           </span><span class="fA ">&#xE006;</span>
<span class="fB ">Line           </span><span class="fF ">&#xE0CD;&#xE0CD;&#xE0CD;&#xE0CD;&#xE0CD;</span>
<span class="fB ">Custom Block   </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

These are all basic walls; they just get in the way. Sometimes
trees can be burned down.

<span class="fB ">Breakaway      </span><span class="fC b0 ">&#xE0B1;</span>
<span class="fB ">Custom Break   </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

These block movement as well, but they can be destroyed with
most weapons (such as bullets or bombs). Certain other things
can destroy them as well.

<span class="fB ">Fake           </span><span class="fA ">&#xE0B2;</span>
<span class="fB ">Carpet         </span><span class="f4 b0 ">&#xE0B1;</span>
<span class="fB ">Floor          </span><span class="f9 b0 ">&#xE0B0;</span>
<span class="fB ">Tiles          </span><span class="f0 bF ">&#xE0FE;</span>
<span class="fB ">Custom Floor   </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

These are all treated as flooring, or "background". Anything,
including yourself, can move onto and over these. They are
primarily for decoration.

<span class="fB ">Web            </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE0C5;</span>
<span class="fB ">Thick Web      </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE0CE;</span>

These are another type of flooring. However, webs are often
the home for spiders, so watch your step!

<span class="fB ">Forest         </span><span class="f2 b0 ">&#xE0B2;</span>

This terrain will block the path of almost any built-in. You,
however, can move through it with ease, clearing a pathway.
Enemies can move along a cleared path.

<span class="fB ">Invis. Wall</span>

This LOOKS like just an empty space... until you bump into it.
Then it becomes a normal wall, blocking your path.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Items</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
<span class="fB ">Gem            &#xE004;</span>
<span class="fB ">Magic Gem      &#xE004;</span>

Your total number of gems is shown on the status screen, and
each gem gives you one point. Many older games also use them as
a type of currency, where you can trade gems for stuff like
food, ammo, weapons, or hints. Magic Gems also give you one
health point apiece when taken.

<span class="fB ">Health         </span><span class="fC ">&#xE003;</span>

This will improve your outlook dramatically. Collecting one of
these increases health by a certain amount. The amount varies
for different hearts. Keep in mind that if you're currently at
your maximum health, running into a heart will still collect it.

<span class="fB ">Energizer      </span><span class="f1 ">&#xE09B;</span>

After grabbing an energizer, the player will flash colors for a
limited time (specifically, for 113 cycles). During this period,
you are invincible against enemies, bullets, fire, lava, poison
damage, and most other forms of pain. Be careful not to get into
a dangerous situation as its energy runs out!

Any energizer grabbed while already energized resets the timeout
period to 113 cycles.

<span class="fB ">Ammo           </span><span class="f3 ">&#xE0A3; &#xE0A4;</span>

When you grab ammunition, it will add a certain amount of
ammo to your supplies. The amount may be different for
different piles.

<span class="fB ">Bomb           </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE00B;</span>

Each bomb you grab adds another to your supply. The sound made
when you grab the bomb will be high-pitched for a high strength
bomb and low-pitched for the rare low strength bomb.

Some boards may not allow the player to collect bombs, and
instead will have bombs ignite on touch.

<span class="fB ">Key            </span><span class="fA ">&#xE00C;</span>

Collect keys to open locks, doors, and gates later on. The key
and the lock/etc. must match colors, and a key will only work
once. You can carry up to sixteen keys at once. The default
status screen, if viewable, will show your current supply of
keys.

If you've played ZZT games, you'll be interested to know that
you can carry multiple keys of the same color.

<span class="fB ">Lock           </span><span class="fA ">&#xE008;</span>

A lock will only open if you have a key of the same color to
unlock it. The key can only be used once and will disappear
along with the lock.

<span class="fB ">Coin           </span><span class="fE ">&#xE007;</span>
Collecting coins is a good idea- they not only increase your
score, but can usually be used to purchase valuable items or
services from vendors.

<span class="fB ">Life           </span><span class="fB ">&#xE09B;</span>

A life orb will give you yet another chance for survival in
MegaZeux. Keep in mind that if you're currently at your maximum
amount of lives, running into a life orb will still collect it.

<span class="fB ">Pouch          </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE09F;</span>

A pouch is usually filled with coins, gems, or even both. The
amount varies, but often you will find yourself pleasantly
rich....

<span class="fB ">Chest          </span><span class="f6 ">&#xE0A0;</span>

A chest can contain numerous things. The contents will be one
of the following: Empty, a Key, Coins, Lives, Ammo, Health,
a Potion or Ring, Bombs, or Gems. Once you grab the contents,
the chest itself will remain, but be empty.

<span class="fB ">Ring           </span><span class="fE ">o</span>
<span class="fB ">Potion         &#xE096;</span>

These mystical items will bestow a magical effect on you when
you wear or drink them. The effect, however, is unknown to
you until you try it... and some effects aren't so nice.
<a class="helpanchor" name="BUILTINS.HLP__prx"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Potion and Ring Effects</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
Effects are limited to the current room only, except for
healing, hurting, and invinco.

<span class="fB ">No Effect</span>

This effect does absolutely nothing.

<span class="fB ">Invinco</span>

Just like an energizer, you will become invulnerable to most
forms of pain until you stop flashing.

<span class="fB ">Blast</span>

Scatters plentiful, random explosions around the screen.

<span class="fB ">Health x10</span>
<span class="fB ">Health x50</span>

Gives the player 10 or 50 additional health points,
respectively.

<span class="fB ">Poison</span>

Reduces the player's health by 10.

<span class="fB ">Blind</span>

Temporarily blinds the player. The viewport will appear in
dark gray. You can still move and interact, but you won't be
able to see anything but the player.

<span class="fB ">Kill Enemies</span>

Kills all enemies in the room, including "Invincible" enemies.

<span class="fB ">Lava Walker</span>

Allows the player to temporarily walk on lava and fire.

<span class="fB ">Detonate</span>

Explodes all bombs and lit bombs in the room.

<span class="fB ">Banish (Dragons)</span>

Turns all dragons on the board into ghosts. Each ghost made this
way will have intelligence set to 4, movement speed set to 4,
and the "Invincible" flag set to off.

<span class="fB ">Summon (Dragons)</span>

Turns all creatures on the board - excepting guns - into
dragons. (This includes other dragons.) Each dragon made this
way will have a firing rate of 3, 4 hit points, and the "Moves"
flag set to on.

<span class="fB ">Avalanche</span>

Scatters boulders randomly around the screen.

<span class="fB ">Freeze Time</span>

Freezes ALL non-player on-screen objects (including all Robots
except the Global) for a short time.

<span class="fB ">Wind</span>

The player retains control but will also move additional random
steps for a limited time. The wind will blow the player in all
directions.

<span class="fB ">Slow Time</span>

Slows ALL non-player on-screen objects (including all Robots
except the Global) for a short time. The resulting speed is
approximately half normal speed.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Creatures</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
<span class="fB ">Snake          </span><span class="f2 ">&#xE0EB;</span>

<span class="fB ">Runner         </span><span class="fC ">&#xE002;</span>

A snake moves in a straight line until it hits an obstruction,
then aims itself in another direction and continues. Hitting a
snake (like all enemies hereafter unless noted) will cause you
to lose health, then kill the snake. Runners act like snakes and
will take up to four hits, but will only go the opposite
direction when obstructed.

<span class="fB ">Eye            </span><span class="fF ">&#xE0EC;</span>

An eye chases you down like any ordinary enemy, but when it
catches you or dies, it explodes! The size of the explosion
can vary with each eye. As eyes float, they can traverse both
goop and lava.

<span class="fB ">Ghost          </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE0EA;</span>
<span class="fB ">Thief          </span><span class="fC ">&#xE005;</span>

A ghost is the simplest enemy, simply chasing you. While some
of them are invincible, most can be killed. Thieves chase but
don't do damage. They steal your gems on touch instead, and can
do so multiple times until killed. Ghosts can traverse lava and
goop; thieves cannot.

                <span class="fA ">*</span>
<span class="fB ">Slime Blob     </span><span class="fA ">*&#xE0B1;*</span>
                <span class="fA ">*</span>

A slime blob usually doesn't hurt you, but it can quickly
become incredibly annoying because of its habit of dividing
into more slime blobs, then hardening into "solid slime"
(i.e. breakables), quickly filling rooms.... You can often
kill slime by touching or shooting it, but some slimes can be
invincible, and others can be harmful to touch.

<span class="fB ">Dragon         </span><span class="f4 ">&#xE015; </span><span class="fC ">&#xE00F; </span><span class="fE ">*</span><span class="fC ">&#xE00F;</span>

Some dragons move around slowly, but their main advantage is
their offense - they can shoot barrages of scorching flame.
Dragons also have a strong defense, taking up to eight hits to
kill. Touching them will take away health, but will NOT hurt the
dragon. Dragons can traverse lava but not goop.

<span class="fB ">Fish           </span><span class="fE ">&#xE0E0;</span>
<span class="fB ">Shark          </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE07F;</span>
<span class="fB ">Spitting Tiger </span><span class="fB ">&#xE0E3;  </span><span class="fF ">&#xE0F9;  &#xE0F9; &#xE0F9;</span>

Fish have to stay in the water and often can't hurt you. Those
that can, however, will hurt you if you're adjacent to them,
even if you're on land. Some fish take two hits to kill. Sharks,
however, swim in lava or goop, are always hostile, and can
attempt to shoot you with fire, bullets or seekers. Spitting
Tigers act like sharks, but are restricted to land.

                <span class="f0 ">&#xE0DA;&#xE0C5;&#xE0BF;</span>
<span class="fB ">Spider         </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE0C4;&#xE0C5;</span><span class="f7 ">&#xE095;</span><span class="f0 ">&#xE0C5;&#xE0C4;</span>
                <span class="f0 ">&#xE0C0;&#xE0C5;&#xE0D9;</span>

Spiders, although eager to catch you, are usually restricted to
movement on webs. Certain spiders, however, can actually leave
the webs. Some spiders take two hits to kill.

<span class="fB ">Goblin         </span><span class="f2 ">&#xE005;</span>

Goblins chase but periodically stop, making them an easy
built-in villain.

<span class="fB ">Bear           </span><span class="f6 ">&#xE0AC;</span>

Bears only move if you get too close, then they lumber over for
the attack. Many require 2 hits to kill.

<span class="fB ">Bear Cub       </span><span class="f6 ">&#xE0AD;</span>

Bear cubs are very lively, rushing all over the place. Since
they move so fast in a seemingly random manner, they are often
hard to kill.

<span class="fB ">Bullet Gun     </span><span class="fF ">&#xE094; &#xE094; &#xE01B;</span>
<span class="fB ">Spinning Gun   </span><span class="fC ">&#xE00F;</span><span class="fE ">* </span><span class="fF ">&#xE01B;</span>

Bullet and spinning guns, both indestructible, fire any type of
normal projectile (bullets, fire or seekers). The bullet gun,
however, is fixed while the spinning gun can fire from all
cardinal directions.

<span class="fB ">Lazer Gun      </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE0CE;</span><span class="f1 ">&#xE082;</span><span class="f9 ">&#xE082;</span><span class="f3 ">&#xE082;</span><span class="fB ">&#xE082;</span><span class="fF ">&#xE082;&#xE082;&#xE082;&#xE082;</span><span class="f7 ">&#xE082;</span>

The indestructible lazer guns fire off lazer walls at regular
intervals, and sustain these walls for a specific length of
time. Unlike in ZZT, getting hit by a laser does not push the
player into objects, though it will push the player if a space
is open. The beam can be obstructed by nearly anything not a
ground type, even including a bullet.

<span class="fB ">Missile Gun    </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE010;</span>

Missile guns fire missiles in one direction. Some fire just
once while others can fire missiles indefinitely. The gun
itself is indestructible.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Puzzle Pieces</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
The following objects are often used to create mind-twisting
puzzles requiring you to push objects all over the place to
reach a goal. Be warned.

<span class="fB ">Boulder        </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE0E9;</span>
<span class="fB ">Crate          </span><span class="f6 ">&#xE0FE;</span>
<span class="fB ">Custom Push    </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Boulders and crates can be pushed in any direction, with any
number of pushable things in a row. They can be blown up.

<span class="fB ">Box            </span><span class="fF ">&#xE0FE;</span>
<span class="fB ">Custom Box     </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Boxes can also be pushed in any direction, but cannot be blown
up.

<span class="fB ">Pusher         </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE010; </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE0FE;&#xE0FE;&#xE0FE;</span>

Pushers cannot hurt you, but they constantly move in one given
direction, pushing almost anything in their path - Boxes,
crates, and even you!

<span class="fB ">Slider NS      </span><span class="fE ">&#xE012;</span>
<span class="fB ">Slider EW      </span><span class="fE ">&#xE01D;</span>

Sliders can be pushed, but ONLY in certain directions. A Slider
NS can only be pushed north/south, while a Slider EW can only be
pushed east/west.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Transport</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
<span class="fB ">Stairs         </span><span class="fF ">&#xE0A2;</span>
<span class="fB ">Cave (or door) </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE0A1;</span>
<span class="fB ">Whirlpool      </span><span class="f9 b1 ">&#xE097;</span>

When you enter any one of these, you are transported to another
location within the current world. These are not always
two-way connections.

<span class="fB ">CW             </span><span class="fA ">/</span>
<span class="fB ">CCW            </span><span class="fA ">\</span>

These rotate in the given direction (ClockWise or
CounterClockWise), rotating everything around them at the same
time. Walls and other solid objects will not be affected.

<span class="fB ">Transport      </span><span class="fF ">} {</span>
                <span class="fF ">~</span>

Most transporters face a single direction. Entering these on
the "open" side, or pushing other things into them, will
cause a jump to another location. Some transporters rotate 360
degrees and can be entered from any side.

The destination of a transport is somewhat complex, but the
search pattern is as follows:

1. If the other side of the entered transport is empty, move
  there. If there is something there that can be pushed out
  of the way, move there and push it out of the way.
2. If the other side is blocked, continue in that direction
  looking for the first non-blocked transporter facing the
  OPPOSITE direction, or an "any-direction" transport.
3. If neither condition can be met, no transport takes place.

<span class="fB ">N Water        </span><span class="f9 b1 ">&#xE018;</span>
<span class="fB ">S Water        </span><span class="f9 b1 ">&#xE019;</span>
<span class="fB ">E Water        </span><span class="f9 b1 ">&#xE01A;</span>
<span class="fB ">W Water        </span><span class="f9 b1 ">&#xE01B;</span>

Water is a type of floor that can be moved onto by the player,
some enemies, and certain other objects. Sometimes, water has a
current, moving you constantly in a certain direction.

<span class="fB ">Ice            </span><span class="fB b3 ">\</span>

Ice is another type of floor. However, the player will slide on
it, constantly moving in the last direction the player moved
until running into a non-pushable obstacle. Attempting to move
in another direction while still on ice will cause the player to
slide in that direction instead.

<span class="fB ">Lava           </span><span class="fC b4 ">&#xE0B1;&#xE0B2;&#xE0B0;&#xE0B1;&#xE0B2;</span>

Lava is another floor. However, it is (almost always) very
deadly. Only a few things can traverse it, puzzle pieces cannot
be pushed onto it, and any player unfortunate enough to walk on
it will typically suffer rapid and massive amounts of damage.

<span class="fB ">Fire           </span><span class="fC b0 ">&#xE0B1;&#xE0B0;</span><span class="fE b0 ">&#xE0B2;&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fC b0 ">&#xE0B2;</span>

Fire is yet another type of floor. It often will spread across
the floor, enveloping trees, chests, brown objects, and
sometimes even empty space. It can damage the player at random
intervals when merely standing near it, and cause constant
damage while standing ON it, but by default fire does far less
damage than lava. Most fires will eventually burn out.

<span class="fB ">Lit Bomb       </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE0AB;</span>
<span class="fB ">Mine           </span><span class="f4 ">&#xE08F;</span>

A lit bomb is an explosion on a fuse. You DON'T want to be
nearby when the fuse runs out... mines, on the other hand, only
blow up when touched, shot, or hit with an explosion.

                 <span class="fF bE ">&#xE0B1;</span>
                <span class="fF bE ">&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fC bE ">&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fF bE ">&#xE0B1;</span>
<span class="fB ">Explosion      </span><span class="fF bE ">&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fC bE ">&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fC b4 ">&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fC bE ">&#xE0B1;</span><span class="fF bE ">&#xE0B1;</span>

                 <span class="fF bE ">&#xE0B1;</span>

An explosion starts at a certain point, quickly spreading
outward, wreaking havoc in its wake. Some explosions are
smaller than others. Explosions will also cause explosives
such as bombs to explode, leading to some very cool chain
reactions.

<span class="fB ">Goop           </span><span class="f8 b1 ">&#xE0B0;&#xE0B0;&#xE0B0;</span>

Goop is pretty much non-traversable terrain to anything
landborne. Sharks may occasionally inhabit it, and select Robots
may be able to walk in it. Bullets, lazers, and other
projectiles will traverse it freely. Goop may also be treated
as water or other terrains in certain worlds.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Miscellaneous</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
<span class="fB ">Door           </span><span class="f2 ">&#xE0B1;&#xE0B2;&#xE0DB;</span><span class="fA ">&#xE0C4;</span><span class="f2 ">&#xE0DB;&#xE0B2;&#xE0B1;</span>
<span class="fB ">Gate           </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE0B1;&#xE0B2;&#xE0DB;&#xE016;&#xE0DB;&#xE0B2;&#xE0B1;</span>

A door is what you would expect - When you touch it, it will
open itself, pushing obstacles in its path out of the way, and
then close after a brief pause. Doors require two free spaces
in the direction it moves to open fully. Certain doors are
locked and require you to use a key to open them. They then
remain unlocked. Gates act similarly, but do not move; they can
be moved over directly when open.

<span class="fB ">Ricochet Panel </span><span class="f0 ">/</span>
<span class="fB ">Ricochet       </span><span class="fA ">*</span>

When a bullet hits a ricochet panel, it is reflected to travel
in a new direction, depending upon the way the panel is facing.
When a bullet hits a ricochet, it is reflected back in the
original direction. Any bullet that hits a ricochet panel or a
ricochet will have its type set to neutral when reflected.

<span class="fB ">Spike          </span><span class="f7 ">&#xE010;</span>
<span class="fB ">Custom Hurt    </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Spikes and other painful devices will simply hurt you if you
touch them. These are often used in conjunction with ice or
with sidescroller engines.

<span class="fB ">Text           </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Another type of wall. Cannot be walked on, but can provide
hints or other enlightening messages.

<span class="fB ">Moving Wall N  </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>
<span class="fB ">Moving Wall S  </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>
<span class="fB ">Moving Wall E  </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>
<span class="fB ">Moving Wall W  </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Moving walls are like Runners - They just move back and forth,
to and fro... they can't hurt you by touch, but can get in the
way very easily.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f8 b0 ">&#xE0B1; </span><span class="fF b0 ">Objects</span><span class="f8 b0 "> &#xE0B1;</span></p>
<span class="fB ">Player         </span><span class="fB b1 ">&#xE002;</span>

This is you. Really. Well, sometimes. The player is often
locked, with a Robot or sprite representing the player
character, but exactly one player object is always present.

<span class="fB ">Scroll         </span><span class="fF ">&#xE0E8;</span>
<span class="fB ">Sign           </span><span class="f6 ">&#xE0E2;</span>

Touch this to display a given message. The message will be in a
message box. A scroll will disappear after you finish reading
it; signs will not.

Unlike in ZZT, scrolls and signs are text-only: they cannot
execute any commands. Also unlike ZZT, messages only one line
long will still be shown in a message box.

<span class="fB ">Missile        </span><span class="f0 ">&#xE010;</span>

Missiles fly around the room, turning at obstructions. They
will explode if they hit the player or when they cannot turn.

<span class="fB ">Bullet         </span><span class="fF ">&#xE093;</span>

Bullets will fly in a straight line until they hit something
(and disappear) or do damage to someone or something. Ricochets
can change the direction a bullet is traveling in, as well as
change its type to neutral. There are three types of bullets:
Player (the player shoots these by default), Neutral (Robots
shoot these in a default shoot command), and Enemy (built-in
enemies shoot these by default). Player bullets cannot harm the
player; Enemy bullets cannot harm default enemies; Neutral
bullets can harm both the player and default enemies.

<span class="fB ">Seeker         </span><span class="fA ">|</span>

A seeker, thrown by a Tiger, Shark, or other enemy, will chase
the player all over the screen until they collide and do damage.
Collision with most projectiles will not destroy it, only pause
it. They have a limited life, however, and will expire after a
certain amount of time or when caught in an explosion.
They are still one of the deadliest weapons you will face;
more than only a few at once can easily ruin a game.

<span class="fB ">Shooting Fire  </span><span class="fC ">&#xE00F; </span><span class="fE ">*</span><span class="fC ">&#xE00F;</span>

Shooting fire will continue in a straight line until it hits
the player (resulting in direct damage) or another object
(resulting in a small fire). The fire may quickly spread out of
control in some areas, or just burn out in others. Bullets can
sometimes destroy shooting fire, but other times the shooting
fire simply absorbs the bullet.

<span class="fB ">Sensor         </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Sensors are a form of floor that only the player can move onto.
They will usually then produce some form of effect, by
interacting with a Robot; other times they act as "save points".
Other objects will push them around instead.

<span class="fB ">Pushable Robot </span><span class="f7 ">?</span>

Robots are the workhorses, the artisans, the... nearly
everythings of MegaZeux. They are highly flexible objects
which can do almost anything. They utilize their own full-scale
programming language, dubbed Robotic. If another object can
do something, a Robot can almost always do it better. They can
show messages, fight the player, play music or sound, set the
entire gameplay structure, and do countless other things. See
the appropriate help sections for more information.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Config File</span></p>
One of the first things a new MegaZeux user should do is edit
the options in the config file; even experienced MZXers may find
some of the customization options novel and useful. Go open
config.txt in any text editor. There is ample commentary to let
the user know how to change the options. Make sure to remove
the # sign from any option you want set!

Editing the options can result in better sound, better / more
customizable graphics, more fitting defaults, a more
personalized Robotic editor, joystick support, extended macros, 
automated backup and much more.

New versions - even minor version changes - have added new
options to the config file, so it is helpful to keep this file
current.

..we want to know! We're very interested in any problems or
bugs you find in MegaZeux. We also welcome any comments,
criticism, or suggestions. We especially appreciate QUALITY
MegaZeux worlds. Here's the contact information as of this
writing:

Check the reports on DigitalMZX's Bug Tracker
(http://www.digitalmzx.net/forums/index.php?app=tracker) to see
if your problem has already been addressed. Active problems and
bugs that are only fixed in a development version of MegaZeux
are listed, as of this writing, in the "MegaZeux" category,
while the bugs that are fixed in a stable version are in the
"Closed MegaZeux Bugs" category. Feature Requests are handled
similarly.

To make things sane for all parties, do this before submitting:
  1) Make sure you have the most current version of MegaZeux.
  2) Make sure that the Bug Tracker doesn't address your bug.
  3) Try to write down what specifically happens.
  4) List what platform(s) you know show this problem.
  5) Try to pinpoint the problem to a specific Robotic line or
     MZX function; at the very least, try to narrow it down.
     Pinpointing which version introduced the bug is very
     helpful, if possible.
  6) If it is a crash, try to run a debug build through GDB and
     post a backtrace of the crash.
  7) If you're unsure if the bug's been addressed, try to build
     a version from GitHub's GIT repository and see if the bug
     is still present in the test build.
  8) Optimally, if the problem is a regression caused by the
     port, upload a world made in 2.70 that works in 2.70 but
     does not in the current version to best isolate the
     problem.
&#xE009; 
Additionally, contacting the developers in real-time can help
illuminate the problem.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Frequently Asked Questions</span></p>
The following is a list of questions that have been received
about MegaZeux innumerable times in some form or another.

Q: I hate that MegaZeux is always windowed! Could you change
  this?

A: There's already a way to switch between fullscreen and
  windowed modes - press Ctrl+Alt+ENTER. Also, the config file
  has an option that starts MZX in fullscreen mode at launch.

Q: How can I get option (foobar) in the config file to work?

A: Make sure the pound / hash sign in front of the command is
  deleted. Otherwise, the option is treated as a comment and
  ignored.
  
Q: Are there any MZX-specific tools that can make developing an
  MZX game easier?

A: Yes, plenty! MegaZeux comes with two helpful tools: 
  "Checkres" will detect what files are referenced by an MZX
  world and which are present, and "ccv" can take an image file
  and output a conversion of it in .chr/.mzm form for MZX use.
  There are also several graphical conversion programs such as
  CharCon. MZX has natural time-savers, of course. Automated
  backups, macros, Robotic code import/export, expressions,
  repeated block copying and other features can help speed up
  development time.
  
Q: This MZX game has some neat things in it! Can I use some of
  these things in my own game?
  
A: It's usually okay to do this, as long as you give definite
  credit to the original creator(s). Unless it was made
  specifically for the game, music and sound from other MZX
  games generally doesn't need direct attribution, but re-used
  artwork and code definitely should get attribution. If you're
  unsure whether the original creator(s) would like you using
  their work in your own game, ask! What we don't want to see,
  though, is passing the work of others - especially graphics,
  writing, and code - as your own. DON'T PLAGIARIZE. JUST
  BECAUSE THEY DID NOT EXPLICITLY FORBID YOU FROM USING THEIR
  WORK DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN PASS IT OFF AS YOUR OWN.

Q: Can I distribute a world I made with MegaZeux? Is it legal?
  Must I/can I include MegaZeux with it? Can they be shareware
  worlds?

A: Of course you can distribute your worlds! That is what
  MegaZeux is for! However, while there are those who would help
  point out your game's flaws in a forgiving manner, not
  everyone is capable of constructive criticism. Playtest your
  game before uploading it, with at least one other person
  evaluating the game for bugs, play balance, and
  text/plot/grammatical errors (when relevant). Get creative and
  make your game worth playing!
  
  Please include any WAV, module, OGG, CHR, MZM, PAL and all
  other files with the games, as well as a cohesive and helpful
  description file or manual. (Using checkres to guarantee that
  every relevant file is included can be helpful.)
  
  While you can simply distribute your game with a copy of
  MegaZeux included, or even just post the game's files in an
  archive by itself, consider releasing your game as both a
  standalone archive and as pure game files in separate
  downloads.
  
  Typically, MegaZeux worlds are freeware, but if you've made an
  assuredly epic and ground-breaking game, then you can attempt
  to ask for registration money in a shareware demo version.
  Just don't get your hopes up. Alternatively, consider
  uploading your game to a platform that allows optional
  donations.

Q: I WANT FUNCTION (FOOBAR) ADDED OR I LEAVE THE COMMUNITY
  FOREVER :<

A: Before you go bugging the maintainer(s) of MegaZeux to add
  new functions, consider these things:
  1) Some things require massive work to implement. These
     things require changing the world, save or board format,
     and format changes are explicitly reserved for version
     number changes.
  2) Some things have been purposely ignored because the
     maintainer(s) deems these things not worth including. In
     this case, it's probably best to pick up the source and
     figure out how to add this function yourself.
  3) You may not be the first to ask for any certain feature.
     Current feature requests are listed in DMZX's Bug Tracker.
     If you are not the first, then you'll often find out why a
     feature is not implemented or, better, you'll end up
     finding out that it is going to be implemented after all!
     Either way, you learn more about the feature and what
     would need to be done to include it.
  4) It's technically possible to add new commands, but
     currently the method of storing Robotic severely limits
     the amount of new commands. Until this system is retooled,
     there will be no new commands. Features that are most
     cleanly implemented through a new command may possibly be
     implemented in other ways, however.
     
Q: Is adding network capabilities to MegaZeux planned?

A: Short answer: Possibly. This has been discussed at-length;
  the biggest problems with adding these to GAMES are thorny
  implementation issues (how the MZX programmer would insert
  network capabilities into a MegaZeux world, as well as the
  structure in general). It's definitely possible, and possible
  to do soundly, but developers don't have netplay as a high
  priority. As for other networking capabilities and MZX, this
  has already been done to some extent (starting with 2.82b,
  MZX ships with an updater program). Implementing tools and
  aids for MZX relying on networking is a lot less thorny of an
  issue, and might be considered.

Q: Will MegaZeux games ever be playable without MegaZeux
  itself?

A: In a sense, they can be now. It was a long-held consensus
  among most of MegaZeux's developers that the possible hassle
  saved for newbies and for those who would instantly refuse to
  play a game because it can't be launched directly was not
  worth implementing this feature. However, this has changed.
  MZXRun, the editor-less version of MegaZeux, can now be
  set to run in "standalone mode", a configuration designed for
  only playing a specific world. This mode changes several MZX
  mannerisms to better accommodate a standalone version of a
  game. The title screen can also be completely skipped.
  Additions to Robotic (such as exiting the game through code or
  blocking the default escape menu) have also facilitated
  standalone releases. Read the comments for standalone_mode in
  config.txt for more information, if interested.
  
  MegaZeux has also been ported to Emscripten, which means that
  MZX games can now be embedded into web pages, allowing play
  without any extra program download or web plugin necessary.

Q: I need more than 256 characters! Could you help with this?

A: Then you'll need to carefully utilize the Robot command
  LOAD CHAR SET and ration your characters carefully. The
  256-char limit is set within the world format and will
  currently be left alone. Also, you might not REALLY
  need 256 characters at once. If you're wanting more
  characters because of heavy character use in animation,
  partial character set loading will probably be the best
  solution. Otherwise, find out which characters will never be
  shown when other characters are and replace them with
  characters you WILL use.
  
  Alternatively, make use of unbound sprites. Unbound sprites
  can access 15 full character sets instead of just one, on top
  of their other benefits.

<a class="helplink" href="#SPRITES.HLP__ubs">Unbound Sprites</a>

Q: How can I load sounds at different volumes in my game?

A: Unfortunately, MegaZeux currently has no way of doing this
  via Robotic. The best you can do for now is load versions of
  your sound that are louder/quieter. Volume settings for music,
  on the other hand, can be manipulated freely.
  
Q: Why is my MegaZeux world starting on the title screen?

A: The first board has to be set. Press 'G' in the editor, then
  set the board using the "First board" field at the top left.
  
Q: Whenever I place a string on the overlay, the spaces aren't
  acting like overlay at all! Is this a bug?

A: No, it's not. Char 32 (the natural space) is never part of
  the overlay. You have to reserve an extra character or use
  the solid character for spaces, or otherwise convert spaces
  to useable replacements during run-time.

Q: How can I input a number over 32767 or under -32768 in
  Robotic?

A: You must use an expression. Encase the number in
  parentheses, as shown here:
  <span class="fE ">set "largesse" to "(2000000000)"</span>
  
Q: My Robot can't change its/the player's characters! I
  use CHAR "A" but it turns invisible! What am I doing wrong?

A: Use CHAR 'A' instead. You MUST use single quotes
  (apostrophes) or it will use the value of the COUNTER
  A, which is probably 0.

Q: Can I use the music from Caverns in my games? How about
  the music from the registered games? How about the SAM
  files?

A: It'd be preferred if you did not use Caverns music in any
  games you distribute, because Caverns music was ancient aeons
  ago. The music from the registered games was illegal to
  distribute; it's now under the GPL, but should be avoided for
  the same reasons Caverns music should. The SAM files are
  public domain and may be used as you please.

Q: Where can I get module files?

A: If you can't make them, search webpages for good ones.
  http://www.modarchive.com has a very large tracked music
  library, as do many old CD-ROM shareware collections. Another
  popular option is to convince a friend to do it for you. If
  your game shows exceptional promise, then an established
  musician in the community might make music for you. You will
  probably have to show real evidence that your game is as good
  as its hype in most cases, however. In any case, remember to
  give credit where it is due (yes, even to yourself).
  Be careful when inserting OGG files into your game. OGG files
  often present considerable bloat to a game if used as music.
  Also, not only may you be chided for putting in a popular song
  if you do so, but you could be violating copyright law.
  Chances are that if you can make a coherent argument on "fair
  use" of copyrighted songs, you will be far less likely to be
  in this position to begin with. <span class="fC ">&#xE003;</span>

Q: What is some good software to create module files?

A: It's a matter of personal preference. Many people prefer
  OpenMPT because it works well with Windows. Others prefer to
  work with Schism Tracker. Finally, a few are still fond of
  Fast Tracker II, and therefore use the similar MilkyTracker.
  DOS-based trackers like IT and FT2 understandably need outside
  tools such as DOSBox to run as expected.

  If you don't mind pumping up your game's filesize, you could
  use any typical composition software (like FL Studio) and
  convert your wave to ogg format.
  
  A third alternative would be Reality Tracker. This tracker
  creates music based on the once-common OPL3 chip found in
  typical shareware-era DOS sound cards. MegaZeux now supports
  files made in this tracker.

Q: How do I make WAV files?

A: There are three easy ways to create WAV files. First, you
  get recording software and a mic. Set it all up (read the
  instructions if necessary) and go for it. Second, you can
  download them or get them from outside sources (such as The
  Freesound Project). Third, you can take existing files and
  change them with effects like echo. Converting .wav files
  intended for sound effects into OGG format is a worthwhile
  idea; the drop in file size compared to the drop in quality
  is huge.

Q: Why do I get garbage when I try reading a file?

A: You likely have it open for writing. To close a file, use
  the command SET "" to "FWRITE_OPEN".

Q: Why does MegaZeux slow down significantly when I set the
  "commands" counter to a high value?

A: You're likely using an idle loop without a CYCLE 1 or WAIT 1
  command inserted. Find the offending loop and add one; if
  you're wary about possible delay effects, rest assured that
  adding either of these will not unnecessarily add delays. It
  will simply end a cycle. By default, MZX will warn you if you
  exceed 2000000 commands in a cycle (but only in test
  sessions). For further information, look up the Cycles and
  Board Scans section.
  
<a class="helplink" href="#PROCESS.HLP__prc">Cycles and Board Scans - How MZX Processes Robots</a>
  
Q: I don't like that anyone can open up my game and see how it
  works, or that anyone can use the editor functions to cheat
  at my game. Is there an easy way to prevent people from
  opening my game in the editor?

A: Nope. MegaZeux used to be able to protect worlds from being
  edited or even played without a password, but this feature
  has long since been removed.
  Releasing games in standalone form can possibly help. While
  anyone who has even cursory knowledge of MegaZeux can still
  fully look through a standalone game, people who have no
  knowledge of MegaZeux beforehand will lack the immediate means
  to heavily manipulate or look through your game.
  
Q: The help file mentions "certain renderers" being unable to
  display unbound sprites. What are renderers, what does this
  mean, and what should I be worried about?
  
A: MegaZeux has several different video settings to accommodate
  a wide range of hardware. The engines used to provide video
  are called renderers, and can be set in the config file or
  changed on the fly in the F2 settings menu. Renderers range
  from basic support (software, does not utilize video hardware
  functions) to features-oriented (glsl, featuring customizable
  filters).
  
  Certain platforms and renderers cannot show extended graphics
  (in other words, unbound sprites and SMZX mode 3 custom
  indices). Right now, this is only a concern for very weak
  platforms that cannot handle much to begin with, such as the
  DS. Pretty much anyone running MegaZeux on an even remotely
  modern computer should be able to view extended graphics.
  
  (Besides the Nintendo DS, the other platforms and renderers
  currently unable are the GP2X and any use of the weak and
  obseleted "overlay2" renderer.)
  
Q: I heard only certain graphics cards can properly show Super
  MZX mode games. Is this true?

A: Not anymore. Any computer that can display normal games in
  MegaZeux can now display Super MZX mode games.

Q: How can I get "mod *" as the default board mod?

A: To set "mod *", use either Shift+8 or the asterisk (*) on the
  numpad.

Q: What's with these "~roboclp.tmp" files packed with so many
  games?

A: Those held clipboard information in DOS versions of MegaZeux.
  They are useless and can be freely deleted.
  
Q: Why doesn't [ work for taking screenshots?

A: It has been changed to F12 and now works in any area in MZX,
  including any part of the editor. Instead of PCX, it now
  currently outputs PNG files by default, but will output MS
  BMP format files on platforms unable to support PNG.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">MegaZeux Limitations</span></p>
MegaZeux has to impose a number of limitations to insure
worldfile compatibility with MZX 2.x worldfiles.

<p class="helpcentered">Memory Limitations</p>
No single Robot can exceed 2 megabytes in size.
No single sign or Scroll can exceed 64 kilobytes in size.

<p class="helpcentered">Quantity Limitations</p>
Item:           Largest number allowed:

Robots              255 per board plus Global Robot
Scrolls/Signs       255 per board
Sensors             255 per board
Sprites             256 per world
Boards              250 per world
Local Counters      32 per Robot plus specialized local counters
                    (e.g. loopcount, lava_walk, bullettype)

<p class="helpcentered">Length Limitations</p>                
Robot Name Length   14 characters
Board Name Length   24 characters
String Length       4,194,304 characters (4 megabytes)
Editor Line Length  241 characters (INCLUDING "extra" words)
* Message Length    512 characters
Input String Length 512 characters
Macro Length        64 characters (for single-line macros)
Mod Filename Length 512 characters (including subdirectories,
                    if applicable)

<p class="helpcentered">Theoretical Limitations</p>
Board size maximum is roughly 16.7 million characters
((2^24) - 1).
Vlayer size maximum is roughly 16.7 million characters
((2^24) - 1).
Board width or height maximum is 32767.
The maximum number of counters and strings depends on
the platform (e.g. between 32 or 64-bit) but is sufficiently
large. You should be fine utilizing hundreds of thousands, or
even millions.

These limitations are mostly theoretical because of the utter
improbability of meeting these limits and the amount of RAM (up
to (hundreds of) gigabytes if fully utilized) they consume.

<p class="helpcentered">Other Limitations</p>
Numbers less than -32768 or more than 32767 cannot be directly
used in Robotic. This problem is a worldfile issue and can be
circumvented by using a constant expression (parentheses).

No board can have a width of a multiple of 256 chars because
this corrupts the board if it lacks an overlay. This problem is
a worldfile issue and widths set to a multiple of 256 will
increased by one more horizontal character regardless of the
status of the board's overlay.

<div class="helpfile" id="THEWORLD.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="THEWORLD.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The World Editor</span></p>
Ready to start creating your own worlds? Then, let's get
started! This section is a short editor tutorial. It will
teach you the basics of creating your own worlds.

To get into the editor, press N or F8 from the title screen. You
will be asked to name a starting board: one can type an
appropriate name and create a second starting board, or press
Escape to cancel and remain on your new world's title screen.
When this prompt is dealt with, you will be presented with a
blank board with a small status bar at the bottom. You can use
Alt+H to pop up a listing of key shortcuts at the bottom. PageUp
and PageDown change its currently shown key shortcuts. The mouse
also works to change pages (but not to select actions). Feel
free to play around with these various options. Press Alt+R to
restart and clear everything (you will be asked for
confirmation, to make sure you really want to go through with
it).

(On Mac platforms, any key shortcut containing Alt can work with
&#xE0BD;&#xE0BE; replacing Alt. So, for above, &#xE0BD;&#xE0BE;+H would pop up the help
listing, and &#xE0BD;&#xE0BE;+R would restart the world.)

For your first world, you should start simple. The very first
board in the board listings is the title screen, so name that
board after your game. (If you opted to create a starting board,
you have to switch to the first board with the B key.) Press I
for board info. This screen will display a bunch of options;
there are loads of important options, but the most relevant
option for now is the "Board name" option. Type in the name of
your game and then click on "OK" or press Tab until OK is
highlighted and press Enter. Now that the title screen is
named, its design begins... or is put aside for later (or even
the end).

If you made a starting board upon creating your world, simply
press B to move to it. If you skipped making a starting board,
you may need to create the first playable board, or location, of
your game. Press A to add a board, then type in a short
description of the board, such as "Starting Board". Press Enter
to go to this new board. This board also needs to be set as the
starting board. Press G to load the Global Settings screen. Once
there, select the First Board option and set it to your starting
board.

Now you are free to doodle around. Use C to change the active
color. Use F3 through F9 to bring up menus of items, terrains,
and creatures. Selecting one with the arrows and Enter will
allow you to place it using arrow keys and space.

For example, press F3 for terrains, and select Line. (This is
a form of wall.) Now move around, placing walls. To ease
this, you can press Tab to toggle draw mode. When draw mode is
active, every move of the cursor will place the current
item/color. The current item and color is shown on the top
line of the menu.

Try to create a pleasing-looking screen, regardless of its
planned function. Some items will require that you set settings
to determine their behavior. To place the player's starting
position, move the cursor to the destination, press F10, and
select Player. Alternatively, press Enter while highlighting
the Player and press Space on the desired destination.

When you are done, press G to go to the Global Info screen.
TAB to the Next button and press Enter. You will now be
highlighting the option "First Board". Press Enter, and select
the starting board (this is where gameplay starts... NOT the
title screen in the vast majority of cases) from the list and
press Enter. Then TAB to OK and press Enter.

You could now press Alt+N to select a module (music) file for
the board, if you wish. Then press S to save the world, and
type in a filename. (The extension of .MZX will automatically
be added.) Press Enter to save the world. Press ESC to exit the
editor, and now you can play your game! You can use L to reload
your world in the editor to make changes, if necessary. See
General Editing Tips for more advanced editing info.

New in the 2.8+ line of MegaZeux is the protection of colors
and characters the editor uses. The editor uses sets outside of
the currently used sets. The character set for the editor is
mzx_edit.chr; only edit if you want to change the editor's
appearance.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<hr /></div>

<div class="helpfile" id="GENERALE.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="GENERALE.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">General Editing Tips</span></p>
The following is a list of important editing tips. They assume
you are familiar with MegaZeux's dialog box system, and that
you can navigate the editor's menus.

<p class="helpcentered">Linking Boards</p>
Simple, one-board games can get boring REALLY fast. There are
five ways to move between boards.

A simple method of connecting boards is with the Board Exits
dialog, accessed by pressing X. Here, you can select boards that
you will reach if you walk off of the screen in a given
direction. The destination board shouldn't have anything in the
way, and will not automatically lead back - you must set the
exit on that board too.

Another way is to use a Robot to teleport a player with the
<span class="fA ">teleport player "boardname" X Y</span><span class="fF "> command. This assumes that you</span>
are familiar with using Robots, but is the only way to go to
another board without having the player walk off-screen, moving
the player into a teleport, requiring the player to have been on
the destination board earlier, or reloading the current world.
Robots can also dynamically set board exits using the
<span class="fA ">BOARD [dir] "boardname"</span><span class="fF "> command, including disabling exits</span>
by inputting NONE instead of the board name.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___t5">TELEPORT PLAYER "string" # #</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___b7">BOARD [dir] "string"</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___b8">BOARD [dir] NONE</a>

The third way is to add stairs, caves and whirlpools using the
Transport (F7) menu. After one is picked, you select a
destination board. The destination board should contain a
similar transport leading back. The two entrances will now lead
to each other.

The fourth way is by saving and restoring player positions using
Robotic. The <span class="fA ">save player position #</span><span class="fF "> command will remember the</span>
current board and player position and save this info in the
given slot #, and the <span class="fA ">restore player position #</span><span class="fF "> command returns</span>
the player to the saved position.

The last way - the most kludge-like - is to load the current
world with a 'swap world' command. This will send the player to
the starting board of the current world, but will restore the
world to its original state. Set counters and strings will be
preserved. This method is used for its powerful restorative
properties.

To switch to other boards in the editor, use B. To add boards,
press A, or press B and select (add board) from the board list.

<p class="helpcentered">Board Sizes</p><a class="helpanchor" name="GENERALE.HLP__sizepos"> </a>
You can change the size and placement of a board's viewport with
Alt+P. You can also choose to center the viewport; this will
automatically set the viewport placement to display the center
of the screen.

You can also change the actual size of the board. The highest
possible size is 16.7 million tiles, though a board that size
would require unreasonably high RAM requirements (128MB). Note
that reducing the size of a board will permanently destroy
anything outside of the new limits.

<p class="helpcentered">Other Important Editing Keys</p>
You can use Ins to "grab" the object beneath the cursor, or
Enter to edit it and then grab it as well. Use P to modify the
settings of the object in the buffer. Use Alt+N to select music
for the current board, or turn the music off if it is already
selected. Use Alt+Z to clear the current board entirely (you
will be asked for confirmation). You can edit important Board
Options with I, and important Global (world) Options with G.

<p class="helpcentered">The Mouse in the Editor</p>The left mouse button acts like space; it places a copy of the
current item over the mouse cursor. The right mouse button acts
like insert; it grabs the current thing over the mouse cursor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___A"><span class="fE ">A - Add (Board)</span></a>

Press A to add another board to the current world. You will be
asked for the name of the new board, and then a new board will
be created. The settings for the new board will be the defaults.
After adding a board, you will be moved to the new board. There
is a limit of 250 unique boards per world.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__075"><span class="fE ">Alt+A - Select Char Set</span></a>

Press Alt+A and select one of the four different character
sets. This will change the current character set to one of the
four defaults. ASCII is the default EGA ASCII character set
(code page 437). MegaZeux default is the default MegaZeux
character set. Blank is the MegaZeux default, but with most
graphical characters blank instead. Text, lines, arrows, blocks,
and certain other symbols are not affected. SMZX set is the
default character set for SMZX modes.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___B"><span class="fE ">B - Select Board</span></a>

Press B to change the current board by selecting from a list.
Selecting (add board) will prompt the user to name the new
board; once named, the board is created and becomes the current
board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__073"><span class="fE ">Alt+B - Block</span></a>

Press Alt+B to start block mode, then move the cursor to the
opposite corner of a rectangular block and press Alt+B again.
You can then select an action to perform upon the block. In all
copy/move operations, the cursor marks the new UPPER LEFT
corner.

Copy block will allow you to duplicate the block by moving the
cursor to a destination and pressing Enter.
Copy block (repeated) will allow same as Copy block, but will
allow copying the same block to multiple places.
Move block will allow you to move the block to a new location.
Clear block will erase the contents of the block.
Flip block will flip the block upside down.
Mirror block will flip the block left to right.
Paint block will change the entire block to the current color.
Copy to overlay will copy the block to the given spot of the
overlay.
Copy to vlayer will copy the block to the given spot of the
vlayer.
Save as MZM will save the block as a layer-type MZM file.

Destinations for Move and Copy can overlap the original block
safely.

You can block copy to other boards by going to the desired board
when prompted to pick the destination of the block; just press B
and pick the desired board.

Also, one can move the cursor across the width or height of the
block by using Ctrl+Dir. This is very helpful for tiling blocks
using the repeated copy function.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___C"><span class="fE ">C - Color</span></a>

Press C to select a new current color from a menu. The thing
under the cursor is not affected. One can jump to a color by
typing its hex code in the color menu; for example, typing "0D"
would jump to color 013 (background color 0, foreground color
D).

A quirk to keep in mind: any entity with a background color of 0
will display the background color of anything beneath it.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltC"><span class="fE ">Alt+C - Char Edit</span></a>

Press Alt+C to edit the character set. The character editor is
a separate section of the world editor and is discussed in
another section.

<a class="helplink" href="#CHAREDIT.HLP__079">The Character Editor</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___D"><span class="fE ">D - Delete (board)</span></a>

Press D to select a board from a list to be deleted. You cannot
delete the first board (the title screen). A deleted board will
be pruned out, with the next actual board taking its place. A
deleted board cannot be recovered or undone, so make sure this
is the desired action.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltD"><span class="fE ">Alt+D - Default Colors</span></a>

Press Alt+D to toggle forcing default colors for placing
built-ins (defaults to on). Turning this off causes built-ins to
be placed with the colors of the object held in the buffer. The
buffer object listed in the status bar will have a red dot at
the end when default colors are off. Only some types of
built-ins, such as creatures and items, have default colors.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltE"><span class="fE ">Alt+E - Palette</span></a>

Press Alt+E to edit the palette (colors). The palette editor
is a separate section of the world editor and is discussed in
another section.

<a class="helplink" href="#PALEEDIT.HLP__093">The Palette Editor</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___F"><span class="fE ">F - Fill</span></a>

Press F to fill in an enclosed area with the current thing and
color. The area must be completely surrounded by things other
than the thing beneath the cursor. For example, you can fill
over a solid square of Fakes with something else. The current
fill command may not work accurately for very large and complex
areas - in this case, you must move to the unfilled areas and
press F to continue filling. This happens very rarely,
however. Also, beware of trying to fill an area with an item
with limited placements, such as a Robot.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__097"><span class="fE ">Alt+F - Sound Effects</span></a>

Press Alt+F to enter the sound effects editor. This editor
affects all triggered sounds resulting from built-in actions,
such as getting hit and shooting. First you must decide whether
to use the default set of sound effects, or whether to edit
your own. You can't edit the default set. If you edit your own,
you will be in a series of three editing screens. Use the Next
and Previous buttons to move between screens. Sound effects,
and the format used to represent them, are described in detail
in another section. The format is the same as used for the
Robotic command PLAY. (Like with PLAY, digitized sounds are
allowed here.)

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltG"><span class="fE ">Alt+G - Edit Global Robot</span></a>

Alt+G will start editing the Global Robot, starting at its name
field.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__CtrG"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+G - Goto Position</span></a>

Ctrl+G will pop up a window, displaying target x,y coordinates.
Set the coordinates by either typing in or selecting the desired
X and Y values, and select OK to go to those coordinates on the
current board. Choosing Cancel or pressing Escape cancels.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___G"><span class="fE ">G - Global Info</span></a>

Press G to enter the global info dialog boxes. The global info
options are covered in another section.

<a class="helplink" href="#GLOBALIN.HLP__086">Global Info Options</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltH"><span class="fE ">Alt+H - Hotkey Toggle</span></a>

Press Alt+H to toggle display of the hotkeys and horizontal
border. The default state of the hotkeys can be changed in the
config file.

<a class="helplink" href="#CONFGINI.HLP__1st">The Config File</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___I"><span class="fE ">I - Info (board)</span></a>

Press I to enter the board info dialog box. The board info
options are covered in another section.

<a class="helplink" href="#BOARDINF.HLP__085">Board Info Options</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__078"><span class="fE ">Alt+I - Import</span></a>

Alt+I allows you to import a number of different file types
into the current board or world. You can import a board file
(.MZB) unique to MegaZeux. You can import a character set file
(.CHR). You can import another world (.MZX), which is appended
to the end of the list of boards. The global of the imported
world will be ignored. (Unlike old versions of MegaZeux, all
exits in an imported world will work.) You can import a palette
(.PAL) file (including a palette indices (.PALIDX) file in SMZX
mode 3) or a sound effects (.SFX) file, all unique to MegaZeux.
Finally, you can import an MZM file at a given position.

Importing boards or worlds will clear the board and overlay undo
histories.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___L"><span class="fE ">L - Load</span></a>

L brings up a list of worlds in the current directory and allows
you to select one to load. You will be warned if the current
world as-is has not been saved yet.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltL"><span class="fE ">Alt+L - Test WAV</span></a>

Alt+L brings up a list of WAV/SAM/OGG files in the current
directory. Selecting one will play it once at its natural
frequency. This has no effect on the actual board or world.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___M"><span class="fE ">M - Move Board</span></a>

M moves the current board to the desired place on the board
list. The title screen cannot be moved, and other boards cannot
be moved to the title screen position.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltM"><span class="fE ">Alt+M - Modify</span></a>

Alt+M allows you to modify the settings of the thing under the
cursor without changing the item in the buffer.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltN"><span class="fE ">Alt+N - Music</span></a>

Alt+N brings up a list of module files in the current directory.
Selecting one will select it as the default music for the
current board. If music is already playing, Alt+N will turn it
off.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__CtrN"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+N - Test Music</span></a>

Ctrl+N does the same as Alt+N, except it only plays the
selected module. It does not set the board module to the
selected module. It also remembers the last-used directory to
maintain a current listening directory. A tested module will
continue to play even if the current board is set to play music,
and even if the current world file is changed.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltO"><span class="fE ">Alt+O - Edit Overlay</span></a>

Alt+O enters overlay editing mode. The overlay is on normal
overlay mode by default. The overlay editing mode is similar to
the normal editing mode, except that only certain keys are
active, and the Enter and Alt+S keys have new purposes. The
overlay is explained in further detail in another section.

<a class="helplink" href="#TOVERLAY.HLP__081">Editing and Using the Overlay</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___P"><span class="fE ">P - Parameter</span></a>

P allows you to change the settings of the current object in
the buffer. The object under the cursor is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__084"><span class="fE ">Alt+P - Size/Pos</span></a>

Alt+P allows you to change the size of the current board, the
viewport size, and location. See the linked section for details.
This action will clear the board and overlay undo histories.

<a class="helplink" href="#GENERALE.HLP__sizepos">Board Sizes</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltR"><span class="fE ">Alt+R - Restart</span></a>

Alt+R will clear the entire world. You will be asked for
confirmation. All undo histories will also be cleared.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__076"><span class="fE ">S - Save</span></a>

S will prompt you for a filename, then save the current world
as a MZX file. The save option will be highlighted if the
world has changed since the last save or load.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__082"><span class="fE ">Alt+S - Status Info</span></a>

Alt+S will allow you to type in six different counters that
can be shown on the default status screen within the game. This
allows you to easily display your own items that the player can
collect, and see how many are currently held. Counters are
discussed in further detail with Robots.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltS2"><span class="fE ">Alt+S - Show Level</span></a>

Alt+S while editing the overlay will toggle whether the level
beneath the overlay is shown in overlay editing mode (defaults
to YES).

<a class="helplink" href="#TOVERLAY.HLP__081">Editing and Using the Overlay</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltT"><span class="fE ">Alt+T - Test</span></a>

Alt+T will allow you to test the current world, starting on the
current board. Games CAN be loaded and saved in this mode,
making it especially helpful for debugging. Test mode also
enables several debugging tools and cheats that can be used
during a test session. Quitting will return to the editor. Note
that entering a test session will clear all editor undo
histories.

<a class="helplink" href="#DBGMODE.HLP__dbg">Debug Modes</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP___V"><span class="fE ">V - View</span></a>

V will allow you to see the current board as it would appear in
the game. Use the arrows to Scroll the view, and ESC to return
to the editor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__083"><span class="fE ">X - Exits</span></a>

X will bring up a menu where you can select exits for each
board direction. For example, selecting a destination board of
"City" for north will cause the player to go to that board when
pressing against the north edge of the current board. Boards
are not automatically back-linked - to make "City" lead back
here, you must go to that board and make a south exit back.
Make sure the linked boards don't obstruct each other's exits,
and that their linking boundaries are of the same size.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__077"><span class="fE ">Alt+X - Export</span></a>

Alt+X will allow you to export a number of different file types.
You can export a board file (MZB) unique to MegaZeux, good for
giving single boards to others. (The character set, palette,
vlayer and global info aren't included!) You can export the
character set (CHR) for later game use or to edit in Fontutil or
another external app. You can export palettes (PAL) [full,
partial, SMZX] and sound effect settings (SFX) for
transportation. Both are file formats unique to MegaZeux.
Finally, you can export the current world, but using the last
version's world format, with the "Downver. world (MZX)" option.

Files like MZMs and SAVs can be exported in-game by Robotic
code. See their respective areas for details. Other file types
such as character sets can be exported generically through file
writing facilities and charset counters. SMZX indices (PALIDX)
can be exported using the Export Palette (PAL) option in SMZX
mode 3; its export dialogue will appear after the palette export
dialogue.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltY"><span class="fE ">Alt+Y - Debug Window</span></a>

Alt+Y will toggle a red box in the lower corner of the screen.
This box shows (on labeled lines) the current position of the
cursor, the current Robot memory situation, and the presently
playing module, and lists the MZX version of the current world
at the top. This is the same as pressing F6 in-game, but removes
the key_code and key_pressed info.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltZ"><span class="fE ">Alt+Z - Clear (board)</span></a>

Alt+Z will clear the current board entirely. You will be asked
for confirmation. Clearing the board will clear the board undo
history as well.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__CtrZ"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Z - Undo</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__CtrY"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Y - Redo</span></a>

Ctrl+Z will undo an action; Ctrl+Y will redo any previously
undone action. Action depth is determined by config file
settings, with 100 as default.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__CtrNu"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Number - Save Editor Position</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltNu"><span class="fE ">Alt+Number  - Load Editor Position</span></a>

These save and load up to 10 cursor positions in the editor
(0 through 9). These positions save both current board
coordinates and active board, so one can save position on one
board and load position from another board. These positions are
saved for that world in its .editor.cnf file.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Sft8"><span class="fE ">Shift+8 OR Numpad * - Mod Wildcard</span></a>

This sets the board's current mod to play whatever played in
the last-visited board. (i.e. The mod playing on that board
differs if entering that board from a board using different
music; it does not stick with the first such mod and play that
from then on.)

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__SftAr"><span class="fE ">Shift+Arrow - Goto Linked Board</span></a>

This goes to the board linked in the given direction, if it
exists. For example, pressing shift+up would go to the board
linked to the North exit, provided there is a board linked to
that exit.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__min"><span class="fE ">- - Goto Previous Board</span></a>

This moves the editor to the previous board in the board list,
if it exists.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__plu"><span class="fE ">+ - Goto Next Board</span></a>

This moves the editor to the next board in the board list, if
it exists.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F1"><span class="fE ">F1 - Help</span></a>

F1 will bring up context-relevant help. You can press F1 at
almost any time.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F2"><span class="fE ">F2 - Text</span></a>

F2 will toggle text mode on and off. When text mode is on,
Enter will go to the next line, and Backspace will delete the
character under the cursor and move the cursor one position to
the left. All printable characters will type in as text,
including pressing the Spacebar.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F3"><span class="fE ">F3  - Terrain</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F4"><span class="fE ">F4  - Item</span></a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F10"><span class="fE ">F10 - Objects</span></a>

The above eight keys will bring up a menu of things to select
from. Selecting one will ask you to enter settings (if
appropriate) or choose a character for that thing. Then a copy
of that thing will be placed at the cursor's location, and will
also become the current object in the buffer. Scrolls, Signs,
Sensors, Robots, and Pushable Robots (all in the Objects menu)
will be discussed in another section. The current thing, color,
and settings parameter (p##) is shown in the upper-right corner
of the editor menu. Knowing the settings parameter isn't
important except for certain Robotic programming situations.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F11"><span class="fE ">F11 - Select Screen Mode</span></a>

Pressing F11 will open a menu, allowing the user to select an
MZX display mode (normal mode and Super MZX modes 1-3). This
setting will persist in editor tests until overridden in-game;
if editor tests are left while in a different SMZX mode, it will
be reverted to the setting given here upon returning to the
editor.

Setting the screen mode is a prerequisite for editing Super MZX
palettes and character sets.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__F12"><span class="fE ">F12 - Take Screenshot</span></a>

Pressing F12 will make a 640x350 screenshot (in PNG format by
default) in the working directory, using the software renderer.
The file naming starts from "screen0". This may be disabled by
changing the allow_screenshots setting in the config file.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AF11"><span class="fE ">Alt+F11 - Robotic Debugger</span></a>

Alt plus F11 will launch the configuration screen for the
Robotic Debugger. For more information on the Robotic Debugger,
go to its relevant section.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__ShF3"><span class="fE ">Sh+F3 - Show Fakes</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__ShF4"><span class="fE ">Sh+F4 - Show Spaces</span></a>

These four keys will cause the given things onscreen to flash
(as the exclamation point character, char #33). They are good
for locating "hidden" or camouflaged Robots, passages, and the
like.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Ar"><span class="fE ">Arrow - Move</span></a>

The arrow keys will move the cursor. The edit window will
scroll when necessary.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__AltAr"><span class="fE ">Alt+Arrow - Move 10</span></a>

Alt plus the arrow keys will move the cursor ten spaces at a
time, or up to the board's edge if under ten spaces away. These
also jump numbers by 10 in dialog boxes.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__BkSp"><span class="fE ">BackSpace - Delete (Main Layer Only)</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Del"><span class="fE ">Del - Delete</span></a>

The Del key will delete everything under the cursor, while
BackSpace will delete the object on the main layer and move any
object on the under layer to the main layer. The current thing
is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__End"><span class="fE ">End - L/R Corner</span></a>

End will jump the cursor to the lower-right corner of the
entire board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__En"><span class="fE ">Enter - Modify+Grab [Board Mode]</span></a>

Enter will modify the settings of the thing under the cursor,
if applicable, then select that thing as the current thing. It
is just like pressing Alt+M and then Ins.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Enter2"><span class="fE ">Enter - Character [Overlay Mode]</span></a>

Enter during Overlay editing mode will change the current
character. Select it from a menu and then press Enter to
confirm your choice.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__ESC"><span class="fE ">ESC - Exit/Cancel Mode</span></a>

ESC will exit the editor, asking for confirmation if your world
has not been saved. If you are in block, overlay, text, or
draw mode, ESC will instead cancel the current mode and return
to normal editing.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Home"><span class="fE ">Home - U/L Corner</span></a>

Home will jump the cursor to the upper-left corner of the
entire board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Ins"><span class="fE ">Ins - Grab</span></a>

Ins will select the thing under the cursor as the current
thing. The thing under the cursor is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Sp"><span class="fE ">Spacebar - Place</span></a>

Spacebar will copy the current thing to the location under the
cursor. Trying to place something over a similar thing will
instead replace the object under the cursor by default. (Robots
and Pushable Robots are the exception; they will never be
replaced.) Placing something over a floor type will actually
place it OVER the floor, not replace the floor. Other things
will be deleted if they are in the way.
Spacebar can also replace similar objects under the cursor with
a space; this can be set in the configuration file.

<a class="helplink" href="#CONFGINI.HLP__1st">The Config File</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__Tab"><span class="fE ">Tab - Draw</span></a>

Tab will toggle the current draw mode. When drawing is on, you
will place a copy of the current object in the buffer every
time you move the cursor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__PgDn"><span class="fE ">PageDown - Next Menu</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="EDITINGK.HLP__PgUp"><span class="fE ">PageUp - Previous Menu</span></a>

These two keys will cycle through the pages of the editor menu.
The menu bar can wrap around. You do not have to be viewing the
page listing a specific option before you can use that option -
the menus are purely for reference.
These keys also jump numbers by 100 in dialog boxes.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Character Editor</span></p>
The character editor is an important part of MegaZeux. With
it, you can change the appearance of the character set. For
example, one can make bricks, rockets, stones, and demons;
using multiple characters, one can make much grander things.
The default pixel resolution is fair - 8x14 per character for a
total of 640x350 for the entire screen. Other modes (known as
Super MZX modes) increase colors at a cost of effectively
halving horizontal resolution, but the intricacies of character
editing in those modes are best covered in that mode's section.

To use the character editor, press Alt+C in the editor. You
will be shown a zoomed version of the current character, a list
of keyboard shortcuts, and a row of characters.

The current character(s) being edited are displayed on the left
edge of the character bar, and also highlighted and shown in
relative position in the middle of the bar. To edit the
character(s), move the cursor with the keys and use Spacebar to
toggle pixels on and off (or left-click and right-click,
respectively). Use + and - to move one character (or character
block) up or down through the character set.

Use Enter to select the current character (or block) from the
entire set. When selecting from the entire set, one can move by
one character using the arrows, or by one block using the -/+
keys.

Use Del to clear the character. Use N to make a "negative", or
inverse, of the character, turning all on pixels off and all
off pixels on. Use Alt with the arrow keys to shift the entire
character to one direction. Pixels shifted off of one edge
wrap around to the other edge.

Use M to mirror the character, flipping it left to right. Use
F to flip the character top to bottom.

Hold Shift to select multiple pixels at a time. The selection
box will vanish once Shift is released. Alt+B will also create
a similar selection box, but will not vanish until the Escape
key is pressed.

F2 will copy the current character to an internal buffer, while
F3 will paste the buffer contents to the current character
space. The buffer can contain a selection of pixels instead of a
character by pressing F2 when selecting a group of pixels. When
copying a single character and pasting to another single
character, the new content simply replaces the old; in other
circumstances, the new content is placed starting with the
cursor position as its upper-left corner with no wraparound. The
buffer is retained between uses of the character editor.

Ctrl+Z will undo actions done in the editor (up to the limit
defined in the config file). Keep in mind that the current
frame is counted in the amount of undo actions.

Ctrl+Y will redo any undone actions.

C will allow selection of colors used in the char editor. This
can be helpful in crafting characters for a specific palette.
Use Alt+C to switch colors back to the default.

Alt+F will flood fill any highlighted area.

Tab will toggle mode (set) on and off. (set) mode will turn all
pixels crossed to ON.

Shift+Tab will turn toggle (clear) mode. (clear) mode will turn
all pixels crossed OFF.

F4 will revert the current character to its EGA ASCII (code page
437) appearance; F5 will revert the current character to its
default MZX appearance.

Multiple characters can be edited at one time. To select a
group of characters, press Enter in the character editor, hold
Shift on the upper-left corner of your desired block of
characters to edit, and finally highlight your block of
characters, release Shift, and press Enter. If more than one
viable character space can be made from the selected characters,
the user can choose the desired space size (e.g. six characters
can be a 3x2, a 2x3 or a 6x1 space). The largest character space
one can use for editing is 18 characters large (6x3, the max
allowed sizes for the respective dimensions).

The extra character sets accessible by unbound sprites can also
be edited in the character editor. Press PgUp and PgDown to
switch character sets, either on the main character edit screen
or on the character selection menu.

Alt+I will import character sets while in the character editor;
Alt+X will export. This can be done with one full set or series
of partials. For a full set, simply select the desired set and
click OK. For saving a series of partials, insert a hash sign
in the set name then choose the Offset (starting character).
Then choose the First number of the series (e.g. char#.chr with
a First value of 5 would start from char5.chr). Then choose the
Count value to indicate how many sets will be saved. Loading is
simpler; simply choose the starting character set, the Offset
value and the Count value. If multiple characters are being
worked on at once, importing and exporting partials can be set
to tile (which will base export and import positions on the
current character grouping) or linear (which will be based on
sequential places in the char set).

The character editor is a key element in creating decent games
with MegaZeux. If you can't seem to draw well with it, that's
okay, since it has some limitations. You can keep practicing
at it, or you can get an MZXer friend to draw characters for
you.

The character editor changes somewhat in Super MZX modes - go
to the Super MZX Modes section for more information on this.

<a class="helpanchor" name="PALEEDIT.HLP__093"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Palette Editor</span></p>
MegaZeux is not limited to the colors it sets as default. The
built-in palette editor can modify colors, which is very helpful
in designing a game. It allows you to change the appearance of
the currently-available colors, and is more user-friendly than
having to change values through code. MegaZeux worlds can only
have one active palette at a time, but can load different
palettes as frequently as desired, so MegaZeux designers can
create different palettes that fit different parts of their
game.

To use the palette editor, press Alt+E while in the MegaZeux
editor. The palette editing screen will appear. The current
palette will be shown to the left, with the current color
marked. By default, the RGB values of the current color and the
current color creation mode are shown to the right of the
visible palette, and the menu is shown below. The color
currently stored in the buffer is shown in the bottom-right
corner.

Some color theory is in order. Computer monitors display colors
by projecting various amounts of Red, Green, and Blue light.
Combined, these three colors can produce almost any shade and
hue of color. This is one way colors are represented in MegaZeux
as well. In the RGB color model (the default), each color has a
Red, Green, and Blue value, each ranging from 0 to 63. 0 is
"off" while 63 is "full intensity".

To make colors other than red, green, and blue, you must mix
them. Purple is red plus blue, cyan is green plus blue, and
yellow is red plus green. (Really.) Whites and grays are made
from equal amounts of all three. For example, Red at 42, Blue at
42 and Green at 0 would be a deep purple, and all as 20 would be
a dark gray. Orange is made with full red, green set to 31 and
blue zeroed out. To brighten a color, raise all the numbers, or
lower them to darken it.

For the RGB color model, use the arrow keys to select the
current color. R, G, B, and A will respectively increase Red,
Green, Blue, and All, while Alt+R, Alt+G,Alt+B and Alt+A will
respectively decrease the values.

Several functions are consistent across all color models. Alt+D
will reset the palette to its default colors (you will NOT be
asked for confirmation). 0 will blacken the current color. Alt+H
will toggle the shortcut display. The PgUp and PgDn keys select
the current color model. Alt+I will import a palette; Alt+X will
export the current palette. Tab will switch to and from a
scratchpad palette that will only exist for the editor session.
Finally, F2 will store the current color to an internal buffer,
while F3 will paste the buffered color to the current color.

In addition to the keyboard shortcuts listed in the below menu,
users can click colors in the palette to select them. Users can
also use the mouse to change color values by clicking on the
relevant areas, and hold down the mouse button to act as a
slider. Color values can also be clicked on and then typed in
directly.

If one is more familiar with other color models, MegaZeux can
create colors with two alternate models: HSL and CIELAB.

HSL creates colors by setting hue (base color), saturation
(color strength) and lightness (brightness relative to white).
Hue can take values of 0-360; saturation and lightness take
values of 0-100. The keyboard shortcuts in this mode are C, S
and V for increasing Hue, Saturation, and Luminance, 
respectively, while alt key combinations of these keys reduce
these values.

CIELAB creates colors through a combination of lightness (L*)
and color values represented by the opponent pair colors of
red-green (a*) and yellow-blue (b*). L* values range from 0-100,
and opponent color values can range from -128 (fully one color
of the pair) to +128 (fully the other color). The keyboard
shortcuts in this mode are V, A and B for increasing L*, a* and
b*, respectively, while alt key combinations of these keys
reduce these values.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Palette Editor in Super MZX Modes</span></p>
Super MZX Modes allow 256 colors at once, and have their own
quirks; therefore, the palette editor changes considerably to
accommodate them. The palette editor for each SMZX mode is noted
below.

<p class="helpcentered">Super MZX Mode 1 Palette Editor</p>
Super MZX Mode 1 does not require any changes, since it merely
interpolates colors. Therefore, palette editing in this mode
acts the exact same as it does in normal MZX mode.

<p class="helpcentered">Super MZX Mode 2 Palette Editor</p>
Super MZX Mode 2's color selection is shown as a 16x16 set of
colors. Each color also represents the four-color palette (also
known as a subpalette) used when an item is assigned that color.
The palette number, as well as its hex number and the four
colors that comprise it, are shown in the upper-left corner. By
default, the color selector shows the current color/palette
highlighted by a white box, with red boxes showing the other
colors of the palette. The buffer stores only subpalettes in
this mode, cycling through each color of the subpalette.

The base values of the current color and the current color
creation mode are shown in the upper-right, and the help menu
is shown below.

On top of the functions allowed in the normal palette editor,
SMZX Mode 2 adds these hotkeys:

<span class="fE ">F5</span><span class="fF ">: Store Colors.</span>

Stores the currently-highlighted subpalette into the buffer.

<span class="fE ">F6</span><span class="fF ">: Place Colors.</span>

Replaces the highlighted subpalette with the subpalette colors
currently in the buffer.

<span class="fE ">Insert</span><span class="fF ">: Cursors.</span>
Turns the display of the red boxes highlighting the component
colors of the given subpalette on or off. Defaults to (on).

<p class="helpcentered">Super MZX Mode 3 Palette Editor</p>
Super MZX Mode 3's color selection is shown as a 16x16 set of
colors. The palette number, as well as its hex number and the
four colors that comprise it, are shown in the upper-left
corner. Since Mode 3 allows user-defined indices, the buffer
display now also includes the currently-stored indices just to
the left of the stored subpalette.

The base values of the current color and the current color
creation mode are shown in the upper-right, and the help menu
is shown below.

In this mode, the highlighted color only corresponds to a color,
NOT to a subpalette; therefore, one can be editing a different
color and subpalette at the same time, and changing highlighted
color will NOT change the current subpalette.

To change the current subpalette, press Space or click the
middle mouse button, and then choose the subpalette to edit.
Each color can be assigned to a color slot in the current
subpalette; to place a color in a subpalette slot, press 1-4 to
put the current color in the corresponding slot (for example,
pressing 2 while on color #120 would make the second color of
the current subpalette color #120).

The Import and Export commands can also handle indices files in
this mode.

On top of the functions allowed in the SMZX Mode 2 palette
editor, SMZX Mode 3 adds these hotkeys:

<span class="fE ">F7</span><span class="fF ">: Store Indices.</span>

Puts the current indices into the buffer.

<span class="fE ">F8</span><span class="fF ">: Place Indices.</span>

Assigns the current subpalette the indices currently in the
buffer.

With the exception of hiding the help, all functions available
to the palette editor in normal MZX mode are available in the
SMZX mode 3 editor.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Global Info Options</span></p>
To edit the Global Info options, press G within the editor.
Here you can edit options that affect the entire world. The
first dialog you see has the following options:

<p class="helpcentered">First Board</p>
Here is where you select which board will be the starting board
for the game. The player will start on this board. This
defaults to the second board in the list, or to the title screen
if a second board was not made when creating a new world.

<p class="helpcentered">Edging Color</p>
This is the color of the area outside of the viewport. It
defaults to dark gray on black (c08).

<p class="helpcentered">Starting/Maximum Lives</p>
This is where you set the number of lives the player starts
with, and how many lives the player can have at any one time.

<p class="helpcentered">Starting/Maximum Health</p>
Same as above, but for health points.

<p class="helpcentered">Enemies' Bullets Hurt Other Enemies</p>
If this is on, then bullets shot by enemies, such as tigers,
will destroy other enemies that they hit. It basically turns
all Enemy bullets fired into Neutral bullets (including ones
shot by Robots).

<p class="helpcentered">Clear Messages and Projectiles on Exit</p>
If this is on, the current message and all projectiles (stars,
bullets, missiles, shooting fire) are cleared whenever the
player leaves the screen.

<p class="helpcentered">Can Only Play World from a 'SWAP WORLD'</p>
If this is on, then the current world is unplayable in a normal
fashion. The only way to play it is to swap to it from another
world, using the Robotic command SWAP WORLD.

<p class="helpcentered">More</p>
This button leads to another screen of settings.

<p class="helpcentered">Edit Chars</p>
<a class="helpanchor" name="GLOBALIN.HLP__089">This button leads to a series of dialogs where you can edit the</a>
characters and colors used to represent various internal things.

<p class="helpcentered">Edit Dmg</p>
<a class="helpanchor" name="GLOBALIN.HLP__090">This button leads to a dialog where you can edit the amount of</a>
damage done by various internal things. Valid numbers range from
0 to 255.

<p class="helpcentered">Edit Global Robot</p>
This button allows you to edit the global Robot, which is a
very special Robot that is present at all times, although it is
not physically on every board. It is a very important part of
MegaZeux. See the section on The Global for more information.

<a class="helplink" href="#THEGLOBL.HLP__gbl">The Global</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#ROBOTICR.HLP__087">Robotic Reference Manual</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="GLOBALIN.HLP__088">The More page of settings for global info has the following</a>
options:

<p class="helpcentered">Death Board/Death X/Death Y/Mode</p>
This tells MegaZeux what happens when the player dies. If the
mode is Same Position, then the player will simply lose a life.
If it is Restart Board, then the player will also teleport to
the location on the board where the player entered. If it is
Teleport, the player will instead teleport to the board and
x,y coordinates stated in the above three settings.

<p class="helpcentered">Endgame Board/Endgame X/Endgame Y/Mode</p>
This tells MegaZeux what happens when the player runs out of
lives. If the mode is Game Over, then the game will simply end.
If it is Teleport, the player will be given one life and one
health, and then will be teleported to the board and x,y
coordinates stated in the above three settings. This will
continue to happen every time the player runs out of lives or
when a Robot calls the ENDGAME command.

<p class="helpcentered">Play Game Over SFX</p>
If this option is on, the game over sound effect will be looped
when the game has ended and the Game Over message will flash
along the bottom of the screen. The Game Over SFX will not play
when the endgame teleport option is chosen.

<p class="helpcentered">Previous</p>
This will go to the previous global settings dialog.

The character editing dialogs (eight pages in total) are screens
of characters and colors used to represent internal things.
Select one to change the color or character used. Use Next and
Previous to move between the screens, and Done when you are
finished. Lit Bomb Anim 1 is special; setting it will set the
other 6 frames of Lit Bomb Animation to the succeeding
characters.

Setting the char of any thing to 255 (always represented by a
magenta question mark in the char select) will allow that object
type to act like a Custom object. This means that the character
it displays will correspond to the object's parameter (so, for
instance, an object with this set and with a parameter of p0a
will display character 10). This is best-suited for things that
do not otherwise use the parameter field, but will work with
objects that have meaningful parameters as well.

Any object type with its char set to 255 that did not previously
use the parameter field (such as Trees) will also prompt a
character selection screen when initially placed in the editor,
much like what happens when selecting a Custom object. Other
objects are placed normally.

The damage editing dialog allows you to change the amount of
damage dealt by various things within the game. Select one and
use the usual dialog keys to change the values, which can range
from 0 to 255. 0 will leave the player invincible versus that
thing.

Editing the global Robot is covered in the Robot tutorials, as
it is (mostly) the same as editing any other Robot. The actual
use of a global Robot is covered in its own section.

<div class="helpfile" id="BOARDINF.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="BOARDINF.HLP__085"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Board Info Options</span></p>
To edit Board options, press I within the editor. This will
bring up a dialog where you can edit options pertaining to the
current board. The options are as follows:

<p class="helpcentered">Board Name</p>
This is the name of the board. It is mainly for internal
reference; however, the name of the first board (the title
screen) is also used to represent the entire world on a file
listing, and its value can be accessed through the BOARD_NAME
string counter in Robotic. The special color codes ~ and @
can apply here, allowing colored text in board names.

<p class="helpcentered">Can Shoot/Bomb</p>
These options determine whether or not the player can shoot or
bomb normally. If off, then the player cannot perform the
noted action. (Other ways of doing these actions in Robotic may
replace the default ways of shooting/bombing and are unimpeded
by this setting.)

<p class="helpcentered">Fire Burns Space/Fakes/Trees/Brown</p>
These options determine what fire will and will not burn
through. Space is empty space, NOT floors; Fakes include fakes,
floors, carpets, and tiles. Trees is self-explanatory. Brown is
anything other than the player or a Robot/sign/Scroll that is
colored brown (that is, anything with a color of cX6).

<p class="helpcentered">Forest to Floor</p>
If on, when the player moves through forest, it will become
Floor. If off, the forest will simply be replaced by a space.

<p class="helpcentered">Collect Bombs</p>
If on, the player will collect bombs normally. If off, bombs
will be instantly lit when touched instead.

<p class="helpcentered">Fire Burns Forever</p>
If on, fire will never burn out. If off, fire will eventually
turn into ash, which is actually a dark gray (c08) Floor. Of
course, if fire is set to burn fakes, the ash will probably
re-light immediately.

<p class="helpcentered">Restart if Hurt</p>
When on, the player will be teleported to the place on the
current board that it originally entered every time health is
lost.

<p class="helpcentered">Reset Board on Entry</p>When on, every time the board is entered, it will reset the
board, acting as if the player is entering the board for the
first time.

<p class="helpcentered">Player Locked N/S</p>
When on, the player cannot directly move north or south until
unlocked with the UNLOCKPLAYER command. (Other ways of moving
the player in those directions, such as Robotic or the player
being pushed, are unimpeded by this setting.)

<p class="helpcentered">Player Locked E/W</p>
When on, the player cannot directly move east or west until
unlocked with the UNLOCKPLAYER command. (Other ways of moving
the player in those directions, such as Robotic or the player
being pushed, are unimpeded by this setting.)

<p class="helpcentered">Player Attack Locked</p>
When on, the player cannot shoot bullets or lay bombs until
unlocked with the UNLOCKPLAYER command. (Other ways of doing
these actions, in Robotic, are unimpeded by this setting.)

<p class="helpcentered">Time Limit</p>
If greater than zero, the player has the noted amount of time
to complete the board. The current time is shown in the lower
left corner during gameplay. If time runs out, the player loses
ten health and the time limit is reset. This option is most
useful with the "Restart if Hurt" option. The time is in units
considerably faster than seconds; test the board to get a feel
for the amount of time needed. The current time is reset if the
player exits and re-enters the board.

<p class="helpcentered">Explosions to Space/Ash/Fire</p>
This determines what explosions will leave in their wake: Empty
space, ash (dark gray floors - in other words, floors colored
c08), or burning fire.

<p class="helpcentered">Can Save/Can't Save/Can Save on Sensors</p>
This determines when the player can save his game. The first
two options are self-explanatory. Can save on Sensors allows
the player to only save if it is standing directly over a
Sensor. Sensors are explained in another section. This only
prevents or limits saving using the built-in save functions;
saving done with Robotic is unaffected.

<a class="helplink" href="#SENSORSW.HLP__094">Sensors - What They Are and How to Use Them</a>

<p class="helpcentered">No/Normal/Static/Transparent Overlay</p>
This sets the type of overlay for the current board. No Overlay
means just that - overlay mode is completely off. Normal
Overlay is an overlay that scrolls with the board. Static
Overlay is an overlay that remains in a fixed position even when
the board scrolls. A Transparent Overlay is similar to no
overlay in that none is shown, but it allows you to edit it so
that it may appear later. Overlays are discussed in full in
another section.

<a class="helplink" href="#TOVERLAY.HLP__081">Editing and Using the Overlay</a>

<p class="helpcentered">Load Charset on Entry</p>This can be set to load a specific charset every time the board
is entered, or set to do nothing.

<p class="helpcentered">Load Palette on Entry</p>This can be set to load a specific palette every time the board
is entered, or set to do nothing.

One can set the current board's settings as the default
settings for all new boards made for this world file. Select
the "Set as defaults" button at the bottom and click or press
Space/Enter. This will save a .cnf file for the current world.
There will be no confirmation. Since the .cnf is named after the
current world, the current world must have been saved first.

<div class="helpfile" id="SOUNDEFX.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="SOUNDEFX.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">MegaZeux's Sound System</span></p>
MegaZeux has two types of sound: Digitized sound, played
through a sound card, and sound effects, which are emulated PC
Speaker effects.

MegaZeux allows OGG, WAV, SAM (a legacy sound format), and
module files (that is, music files) for digitized sound.

MegaZeux's many sound options can be accessed through the
config.txt file. Please see this section for details.

<a class="helplink" href="#CONFGINI.HLP__1st">The Config File</a>

<p class="helpcentered">Music Files</p>
Music files, referred to as MODULES, can be any one of the
following formats:

* OGG
* MOD (or NST/WOW/OCT)
* S3M
* XM
* IT
* GDM
* RAD
* Other formats {STM, MTM, 669, ULT, FAR, MED, OKT, AMF}
* Several other formats are in ModPlug or XMP, but are not
  supported in MZX.

The default module engine is XMP. It is still possible to build
using ModPlug, and possible to build using MikMod to support
platforms that cannot handle anything else. OGGs, WAVs and RADs
are handled outside of the module engines, while GDMs load
natively in XMP/MikMod, but not in ModPlug. When a GDM is loaded
with ModPlug as the music engine, it is converted to an S3M
file. The S3M file is then loaded in all future incidences.

Formats common to all engines are MOD, S3M, XM, IT, STM, MTM,
669, ULT, FAR, MED, OKT and AMF. All other formats (excluding
WAV/OGG/SAM/GDM/RAD) are locked out of MZX by default.

MED support is the most inconsistent between module engines,
due to its multiple subversions and the engines' varying
accuracy on dealing with them, so use of this format is not
generally advised.

MZX supports loop markers for OGG files. OGG loops are supported
with the LOOPSTART, LOOPLENGTH and LOOPEND metadata tags. MZX
can also control OGG looping dynamically with the MOD_LOOPSTART
and MOD_LOOPEND counters.

<p class="helpcentered">Using Sound and Music in Your Own Games</p>
There are three ways to utilize sound and music in your own
games:

 1- Select the default modules for each board (or mod *).
 2- Edit the built-in speaker sfx tables.
 3- Use Robots to play modules, SAMs/WAVs/OGGs, and speaker
   sfx.

<p class="helpcentered">Selecting Default Modules for Each Board</p>
This is perhaps the easiest method to get music in your games.
Simply make sure that the proper module files are in the
current directory, or in a subdirectory of the current
directory, and use Alt+N to select music for a board. Press
Alt+N to turn it back off again. To set it to play the same
music as the last board (mod *), press Shift+8 or the numpad's
asterisk key.

<a class="helplink" href="#EDITINGK.HLP__AltN">Details on Alt+N</a>

<p class="helpcentered">Editing the Built-in Speaker SFX</p>
To edit the built-in speaker sound effect tables, use Alt+F.
The format for them is discussed later in this section.

<a class="helplink" href="#EDITINGK.HLP__097">Details on Alt+F</a>

<p class="helpcentered">Using Robots</p>
Robotic has a large number of commands for playing modules,
SAMs/WAVs/OGGs, and speaker sfx. A knowledge of Robotic basics
is required, so see the following sections to learn about
Robots.

<a class="helplink" href="#ROBOTSWH.HLP__1st">Robots - What They Are and How to Use Them</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#ROBOTICT.HLP__1st">Robotic Tutorial</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#ROBOTICR.HLP__087">Robotic Reference Manual</a>

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___w4"><span class="fA ">WAIT PLAY "string"</span></a>

<p class="helpcentered">SAM Files in the Port</p>
SAM files, formerly the only format for playing sounds in MZX,
are directly supported. However, using OGGs or WAVs as the
original source, if possible, is preferred as SAMs are low
quality (~8KHz mono) compared to typical WAV and OGG quality
settings. SAM support is mostly kept in for supporting older
games, not for usage in designing games.

<p class="helpcentered">Format for Sound Effects</p>
The sound effects editor and Robotic PLAY commands all use the
same format for playing sound effects. The format consists of
a single string of characters, each character representing one
note or command. Spaces are ignored, and capitalization is not
important. Some knowledge of music is required to use the
format effectively. The commands are:

<span class="fA "> A B C D E F G</span>
  Plays the note stated, at the current octave and duration.
  The scale starts at C and continues DEFGAB before going up
  an octave. Use # and $ for sharps and flats, placing them
  after the note.
<span class="fA "> # $</span>
  Sharps (#) or flats ($) the previous note. This does not
  affect any note other than the note directly before the sharp
  or flat. Constructs such as B# are allowed.
<span class="fA "> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6</span>
  Sets the current octave. MZX octaves are shifted a number back
  resulting in octave 3 starting at middle C (aka c'). The lower
  the number, the lower the notes.
<span class="fA "> + -</span>
  Raises or lowers the current octave by 1, but only if
  possible. You cannot go below octave 0 or above octave 6.
<span class="fA "> X</span>
  Plays a rest of the current duration. A rest is a period of
  silence.
<span class="fA "> Z T S I Q H W</span>
  These letters change the current duration of notes and rests,
  I.E. the length of time each subsequent note is played. Each
  one is twice as long as the previous one, with Z being the
  fastest and W the slowest. Duration defaults to T. The
  counterparts to the durations follow:
   Z = sixty-fourth note
   T = <span class="fA ">T</span><span class="fF ">hirty-second note</span>
   S = <span class="fA ">S</span><span class="fF ">ixteenth note</span>
   I = e<span class="fA ">I</span><span class="fF ">ghth note</span>
   Q = <span class="fA ">Q</span><span class="fF ">uarter note</span>
   H = <span class="fA ">H</span><span class="fF ">alf note</span>
   W = <span class="fA ">W</span><span class="fF ">hole note</span>
  Duration (and octave) does not carry over from one string to
  the next.
<span class="fA "> .</span>
  A dot will change the current duration to 150% that of usual.
  This is a permanent duration change and will only affect
  subsequent notes. Its use is similar to that of a dot in
  regular music, except that this dot affects multiple notes.
<span class="fA "> !</span>
  An exclamation point will change the current duration to 33%
  that of usual. This is a permanent duration change and will
  only affect subsequent notes. Its use is similar to that of
  triplets in regular music, except it affects ALL subsequent
  notes.
<span class="fA "> &</span>
  & is a very special command. It is used to play SAM/WAV/OGG
  files (digitized sounds) within an sfx string. It allows
  digitized sounds within the sound effects editor. The general
  format for & is as follows:

<p class="helpcentered">"&FILENAME.WAV&4C"</p>
  This will play FILENAME.WAV at a pitch of 4c, which
  corresponds to a sample rate of 8363Hz. Any given durations
  are irrelevant. If nothing follows the last &, the effect will
  play at the file's natural frequency. Multiple filenames can
  be used in the same PLAY command, but only the last one can
  have nothing following its last &.
<span class="fA "> _</span>
  An underscore is usually used in conjunction with &. It
  turns off digitized sounds for the rest of the string, and
  ignores the rest of the string ONLY IF digitized music/sound
  is on. For example:

<p class="helpcentered">"&SHOT.WAV&6F#_+C-C"</p>
  The above will play SHOT.WAV at a sample rate of roughly 48KHz
  (F-sharp, 6th octave) if digitized sound is on, OTHERWISE it
  will play the normal shooting sound of "+C-C".

<p class="helpcentered">Sound Effect Numbers</p>
The PLAY SFX command in Robotic plays one of the built-in sound
effects. The numerical values corresponding to these sound
effects are listed below.

The following tables list how to play a Wave or OGG at its
normal sound with PLAY statements:

 48000Hz Wave/OGG --> 37
 44100Hz Wave/OGG --> 41
 32000Hz Wave/OGG --> 56
 24000Hz Wave/OGG --> 75
 22050Hz Wave/OGG --> 81
 16000Hz Wave/OGG --> 112
 12000Hz Wave/OGG --> 149
 11025Hz Wave/OGG --> 162
 08000Hz Wave/OGG --> 224

To convert frequencies from MZX to real, use these formulae:

 Actual frequency = 1789682 / MZX frequency
 MZX frequency = 1789682 / actual frequency

SAMs and WAVs converted from SAMs by older versions of MZX play
at a natural frequency of 8363Hz.

Finally, tracked modules have a normal frequency of 44100 Hz;
OGGs, on the other hand, have normal frequencies at their
recording rate (for example, a OGG encoded at 22050 Hz will play
normally at the 22050 Hz setting). The frequency of a module can
be controlled with the "mod_frequency" counter. Changing the
frequency mid-song can create a popping sound, especially while
lowering frequency. The lowest allowed setting of mod_frequency
is 16 Hz.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Editing and Using the Overlay</span></p>
The overlay is a simple but useful part of a board. If one
looks at Floors and Fakes as a floor layer, and Walls as a
central layer, the overlay is a ceiling layer. Basically, the
overlay, when on, appears OVER anything on the board. The
player, enemies, Robots, etc. all move underneath it; the only
exceptions are sprites specifically set to go over it. The
overlay is purely for show and graphical effects. For example,
you could create archways that the player moves under, or have
a score and lives display that is overlaid over the view at all
times (by using Robotic). However, character 32 (empty space
99.99% of the time) is never part of the overlay. To emulate a
space, use the wall character or make your own space character.
This is very important to remember when putting text onto the
overlay.

The overlay is set on "Normal Overlay" mode by default. The
editor will prevent you from editing the overlay if it is Off,
since it will not be saved if it is. These are the available
overlay modes:

Off - No overlay is saved, none is shown.
Normal - The overlay is shown normally, scrolling along with
  the rest of the board. Default for boards.
Static - The overlay is shown, but it does not scroll with the
  board. It always shows the top left position.
Transparent - The overlay is saved and can hold info, but is
  currently not shown.

If the overlay is on, press Alt+O in the editor to edit it.
This brings you to the overlay editor. The menu at the bottom
of the screen will change, and you will have access to the
following keys and options:

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__074"><span class="fE ">Alt+B - Block</span></a>

Press Alt+B to start block mode, then move the cursor to the
opposite corner of a rectangular block and press Alt+B again.
You can then select an action to perform upon the block. In all
copy/move operations, the cursor marks the new UPPER LEFT
corner.

Copy block will allow you to duplicate the block by moving the
cursor to a destination and pressing Enter.
Copy block (repeated) is the same as Copy block but can allow
copying of the same block to multiple places.
Move block will allow you to move the block to a new location.
Clear block will erase the contents of the block.
Flip block will flip the block upside down.
Mirror block will flip the block left to right.
Paint block will change the entire block to the current color.
Copy to board will copy the block to the given spot of the
board. You can choose to place it as either Custom Block, Custom
Floor, or Text.
Copy to vlayer will copy the block to the given spot of the
vlayer.
Save as MZM will save the block as a layer-type MZM file.

Destinations for Move and Copy can overlap the original block
safely. Ctrl+Dir is especially helpful when doing a repeated
copy block; it moves the cursor the width or height of the
block, ensuring no overlap when pasting.

Like normal Block functions, one can copy between boards by
selecting the board when the editor prompts the user for the
block's destination. Use the B key to select the destination
board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP___C"><span class="fE ">C - Color</span></a>

Press C to select a new current color from a menu. The thing
under the cursor is not affected. One can jump to a color by
typing its hex code in the color menu; for example, typing "0D"
would jump to color 013 (background color 0, foreground color
D).

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP___F"><span class="fE ">F - Fill</span></a>

Press F to fill in an enclosed area with the current character
and color. The area must be completely surrounded by characters
other than the character beneath the cursor. For example, you
can fill over a solid square of As with something else. The
current fill command may not work right for very large and
complex areas- In this case, you must move to the unfilled areas
and press F to continue filling. However, this happens very
rarely.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__AltO"><span class="fE ">Alt+O - Edit Overlay</span></a>

Alt+O will exit overlay mode and return to editing the main
board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__AltS2"><span class="fE ">Alt+S - Show Level</span></a>

Alt+S will toggle whether the level beneath the overlay is
shown. Without the level, only the overlay is shown, and no
board bits are seen through the holes in the overlay. However,
it can be a good idea to show the level to see how it looks
beneath the overlay.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__F1"><span class="fE ">F1 - Help</span></a>

F1 will bring up context-relevant help. You can press F1 at
almost any time.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__F2"><span class="fE ">F2 - Text</span></a>

F2 will toggle text mode on and off. When text mode is on, Enter
will go to the next line, and Backspace will delete going
backwards. All printable characters will type in as text.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Ar"><span class="fE ">Arrow - Move</span></a>

The arrow keys will move the cursor. The edit window will scroll
when necessary.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__AltAr"><span class="fE ">Alt+Arrow - Move 10</span></a>

Alt with the arrow keys will move the cursor ten spaces at a
time (or to the edge if under 10 spaces away in that direction).

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__BkSp"><span class="fE ">Backspace - Delete</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Del"><span class="fE ">Del - Delete</span></a>

These two keys will delete any overlay under the cursor. The
current character is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__End"><span class="fE ">End - L/R Corner</span></a>

End will jump the cursor to the lower-right corner of the entire
overlay.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Enter2"><span class="fE ">Enter - Character</span></a>

Enter will alter the current character on the overlay. Select it
from a menu and then press Enter to confirm your choice.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__ESC"><span class="fE ">ESC - Exit/Cancel Mode</span></a>

ESC will exit overlay mode. If you are in block, text, or draw
mode, ESC will instead cancel the current mode and return to
normal overlay editing.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Home"><span class="fE ">Home - U/L Corner</span></a>

Home will jump the cursor to the upper-left corner of the
entire overlay.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Ins"><span class="fE ">Ins - Grab</span></a>

Ins will select the character and color under the cursor
as the current. The actual character is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Sp"><span class="fE ">Spacebar - Place</span></a>

Spacebar will copy the current character and color to the
location under the cursor. Other overlay will be deleted if it
is under the cursor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__Tab"><span class="fE ">Tab - Draw</span></a>

Tab will toggle the current draw mode. When drawing is on, you
will place a copy of the current character every time you move
the cursor.

<span class="fE ">P - Change Buffer Character</span>

P will act much like Enter, but only change the character in the
buffer; no character on the overlay is changed with this action.

<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__CtrZ"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Z - Undo</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="TOVERLAY.HLP__CtrY"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Y - Redo</span></a>

Ctrl+Z will undo an action; Ctrl+Y will redo any previously
undone action. Action depth is determined by config file
settings, with 100 as default.

The basic method of editing the overlay is to use C and Enter to
select characters and colors, and use Space, arrows, and Tab to
draw with them. Do not switch overlay mode to Off once you have
drawn your overlay, or it may be permanently erased.

The overlay and overlay mode can also be changed using Robotic;
with Robotic, not only can one powerfully manipulate the
overlay, but change the overlay's type, and also copy directly
to the board or vlayer from the overlay (and vice versa). A
knowledge of Robotic basics is required, so see the following
sections to learn about Robots.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Signs and Scrolls in the Editor</span></p>
Signs and scrolls are a simple way to get messages across in
the game. Signs can be read multiple times; scrolls can be read
once, then disappear. To place them in the editor, press F10 and
select Sign or Scroll from the list. You must then edit the text
of the sign or scroll.

The Scroll editor is very simple. You can move the cursor among
the different lines and characters. Type to insert text
anywhere. Press Ins to toggle between insert mode (default)
and overwrite mode, where typed characters will overwrite any
characters already there. Backspace and delete work as normal,
as do PageDown, PageUp, End, and Home. Finally, use Enter to
start or insert new lines.

Press ESC when you are done editing your sign or scroll. It will
be placed at the current cursor position and will become the
current object in the buffer. Note that although you can now
copy the scroll freely, there is a limit of 255 scrolls and
signs per board, but this limit shouldn't ever be a problem.

<div class="helpfile" id="DBGMODE.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="DBGMODE.HLP__dbg"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Debug Modes</span></p>
The debug modes are powerful tools. MegaZeux contains two types
of debug modes: the Counter Debug Mode and the Robotic
Debugger.

<p class="helpcentered">Counter Debug Mode</p><a class="helpanchor" name="DBGMODE.HLP__100"> </a>
The counter debug mode - accessed by pressing F11 while running
a world during playtesting in the editor - not only can pause
all current MZX world action and display all of the counters
and strings the world has set, but also can manipulate these
values and even add new ones.

The left side of the counter debug mode shows the current
selection of counters/strings. Built-in counters ending with an
asterisk (*) are read-only. Highlighting a counter/string and
either clicking it or pressing Enter/Space while on it will
bring up a box, allowing the value of the counter/string to be
changed. Type in the desired new value, and press Enter to set
the counter/string to the new value. Press Escape to cancel
setting a new value.

(PLEASE NOTE: Strings can only show and set its first 68
characters when attempting to set a new value. If a string
originally contained over 68 characters, none of the characters
past the 68th will show in the value setting box, even when any
of the first 68 characters are deleted. Simply choosing to set
a value, while not doing anything else, will truncate the
string down to its first 68 characters.)

These counters and strings are organized into various lists,
shown in the upper-right. Selecting one of these lists will
display its contents in the left-side box. If a list has a plus
sign next to it, it is a tree, and clicking on it or pressing
Space or Enter will expand it to show any of that tree's
sub-lists (if they exist). Click again to hide the sub-lists.

The lists are as follows:

<span class="fA ">Counters</span><span class="fF ">: Lists all user-defined counters, as well as status</span>
counters (things like AMMO, HEALTH, etc) and menu counters,
followed by their values. Expanding this tree will allow
selection of lists sorted by starting character - individual A
through Z lists contain only counters starting with their
respective characters, and # does the same for everything else.
Only the first 45 characters of a counter name will be shown.

<span class="fA ">Strings</span><span class="fF ">: Lists all user-defined strings, followed by their</span>
values. Expanding this tree will allow selection of lists
sorted by starting character - individual A through Z lists for
the respective characters, and # for everything else. Only the
first 16 characters of a string name (including the $) and the
first 40 characters of a string value will be shown.

<span class="fA ">Sprites</span><span class="fF ">: Lists the global sprite counters and their values.</span>
Expanding this list will allow selection of lists sorted by
relevant sprite - "spr1","spr2", and so on. Each spr# list
shows all of each sprite's relevant counters. The number of
currently-active sprites is given under the "Active sprites"
entry.

<span class="fA ">Universal</span><span class="fF ">: Lists counters which persist throughout an entire</span>
session of MegaZeux, as well as their values.

<span class="fA ">World</span><span class="fF ">: Lists built-in world counters/strings and their values.</span>

<span class="fA ">Board</span><span class="fF ">: Lists the current board's built-in board counters/strings</span>
and their values. Also can expand to show lists of scrolls/signs
(both under "Scrolls") and sensors, if any of these items exist
on that board. For scrolls/signs, each list shows a "Scroll
text" entry; if clicked or Enter is pressed while highlighted,
it views that scroll's/sign's text as it would be if encountered
in-game (i.e. in the currently-loaded charset, not the protected
charset). For sensors, each list shows the sensor name and the
Robot it messages.

<span class="fA ">Robots</span><span class="fF ">: If directly highlighted, this option lists nothing.</span>
However, expanding this tree will allow selection of lists
sorted by the robot_id of the current board's Robots - starting
with "0: <name>" for the Global, and continuing on for each
Robot on the board. Each list displays that Robot's local
counters and their values (as well as their robot_name
strings).

In addition, certain special values can be accessed in this
menu.
-The number of commands that the given Robot has processed is
listed under its commands_total value.
-The number of commands that the given Robot has executed in
the current cycle is listed under its commands_cycle value.
This value is read-only.
-Whether the given Robot is locked or unlocked is denoted by
the value of lockself (0 for unlocked, 1 for locked).

Outside of directly displaying and setting values of counters
and strings, the counter debug mode has several other tools at
its disposal. They are given buttons in the lower-right corner,
and are as follows:

<span class="fA ">Search</span><span class="fF ">: Locates names and values in any of the counters/strings</span>
listed in the counter debug mode. Type the desired search
string and select from the given options, then press Enter. The
search begins from the last highlighted line. This menu can be
directly accessed with Ctrl+F, and an instant repeat of the
last search can be done with Ctrl+R. Options:
-Search names: Searches counter and string names.
-Search values: Searches counter and string values.
-Case sensitive: Returns results only if case matches.
-Exact: Returns results only if the entire string or counter
value matches (as opposed to if part of the string or counter
value matches).

default top to bottom).

of the current list will not be searched.

<span class="fA ">New</span><span class="fF ">: Creates a new counter or string with the given name. Its</span>
value will be 0 for a new counter, and blank for a new string.
If any counter or string already exists with the given name,
this will be ignored and the original counter/string will keep
its original value. You will not be notified of any such
conflicts. This menu can be directly accessed with Alt+N.

<span class="fA ">Toggle Empties</span><span class="fF ">: Sets whether counters with values of 0 and</span>
blank strings are shown in the display lists. Defaults to Show
(i.e. counters and strings with these values will be shown).
Searching forces this setting to Show. This menu can be
directly accessed with Alt+H.

<span class="fA ">Export</span><span class="fF ">: Exports a text file list of SET commands that would set</span>
the current user-defined counters and strings, and the built-in
counters in the Counters parent list, to their current values.
If overwriting a current file is chosen, MZX will ask for
confirmation.

In addition to its own considerable power, accessing the counter
debug mode can allow access to the character editor (via Alt+C)
or the palette editor (via Alt+E) for further manipulation and
testing.

<p class="helpcentered">The Robotic Debugger</p><a class="helpanchor" name="DBGMODE.HLP__101"> </a>
Ever have problems with a Robot choking your game to a crawl?
Can't figure out how someone else's code works from a simple
lookthrough? Are your Robots just not interacting the way you'd
planned? The Robotic Debugger might help. The Robotic Debugger
can enable controlled line-by-line execution of Robots, or even
halt Robot execution altogether.
<a class="helpanchor" name="DBGMODE.HLP__102"> </a>
Since stepping through code line-by-line can be very, very
tedious if unneeded, the debugger only starts allowing such
control after meeting given conditions. The conditions that
tell the debugger when to begin stepping through lines are
called breakpoints.

MegaZeux does not provide default breakpoints (with one notable
exception explained later), so suitable breakpoints must be
created. Pressing Alt+F11 while in the editor or during an
editor testplay will load the config screen for the Robotic
Debugger.

Breakpoints can be added by using Alt+N or Alt+A, or by clicking
the "(new)" text. Breakpoints will activate stepping when
characters in a line of code match a given string, preventing
the line triggering the breakpoint from executing. Additionally,
the breakpoint can be set to trigger only for Robots whose names
contain the characters in another given string, or only when the
condition is met on a given line number.

A blank string can be set as a breakpoint. In this case, all
lines running in Robots matching the given Robot name string
will trigger the debugger, and all line numbers matching a given
line number will likewise always trigger. However, leaving all
string fields blank and line number at 0 will have no notable
effect.

String matches for breakpoints, like MegaZeux string comparisons
in general, do not have to match case. Also, as implied, the
string comparisons are not for the whole line or Robot name; the
lines or names must merely contain the given strings.

Similar to breakpoints are watchpoints. Watchpoints activate
stepping as well, but are based off of the values of counters
and strings, and only activate stepping after a relevant value
is changed, not right when one is seen. Unlike with breakpoints,
the watchpoint string has to exactly match (although case
insensitive). Local counters can be watched as well as global
counters; to watch local counters, check for rN.<counter>, where
N is the robot_id, and <counter> is the relevant local counter
name (without the angle brackets).

Editing breakpoints/watchpoints is done by pressing Space.
Deleting breakpoints/watchpoints is done by pressing Alt+D.

The Robotic debugger defaults to off. Clicking the Enable
Robotic Debugger button, or adding a breakpoint or watchpoint,
activates the debugger from that point on. Once done editing
breakpoints and watchpoints, click the Done button.

In addition to user-defined breakpoints and watchpoints,
MegaZeux also activates stepping through the debugger when Robot
processing reaches very high amounts; if the debugger was
currently off, hitting this condition forces it on. By default,
this happens when a Robot executes over 2,000,000 commands in a
single cycle, but this can be changed by changing the value of
the COMMANDS_STOP counter.

Once a breakpoint or watchpoint is hit, MegaZeux halts execution
of all actions and opens up a menu. Actions, and the keys that
activate them, are as follows:

<span class="fA ">Continue</span><span class="fF ">: Stops stepping through code until the next</span>
breakpoint/watchpoint is hit. (C or Escape)

<span class="fA ">Step</span><span class="fF ">: Steps through the current line, executing it, and</span>
prompts the user for further action at the next line. (S)

<span class="fA ">Goto</span><span class="fF ">: Opens up a menu to send Robots to a given label. (G)</span>
All Robots that match the given Name string (or all Robots for
blank) will be sent to the given label. The Goto option will
send the relevant Robots to the given label regardless of locked
status; the Send option will act as a normal label send; the
Send All option will act as a normal label send to all Robots.
Select the "Send/send all ignores locked status?" option to have
these ignore locked states as well.

The strings given here do not have to be constants; expression
outputs and interpolated strings will evaluate correctly for
these values.

<span class="fA ">Halt</span><span class="fF ">: Makes the Robot running the current line immediately</span>
stop processing commands. Note that this does not permanently
stop the Robot from processing commands in the future (e.g. due
to being sent to a label); it merely prevents it from running
its currently planned commands. (H)

<span class="fA ">Halt All</span><span class="fF ">: Immediately makes ALL Robots stop processing</span>
commands. (Alt+H)

<span class="fA ">Counters</span><span class="fF ">: Opens up the Counter Debug Mode. (F11)</span>

<span class="fA ">Breakpoints</span><span class="fF ">: Opens up the Robotic Debugger config. (Alt+F11)</span>

The PgUp and PgDn keys can shift the debugger window to the top
or bottom of the screen, respectively.

<span class="f9 ">MZX General Errors</span>

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__era"><span class="fA ">Cannot decrypt write-protected world; check permissions</span></a>

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage. It can also result from an attempt to overwrite a
read-only file.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erb"><span class="fA ">Cannot overwrite the player- move it first</span></a>

The user attempted to place an object over the player. The
player must be moved from its current location if something
else is desired at that location.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erc"><span class="fA ">Current renderer lacks advanced graphical features; features</span></a>
<span class="fA ">disabled</span>

Certain graphics renderers (at present, the overlay2 renderer)
are unable to utilize some newer features. Try running MegaZeux
under a different renderer.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erd"><span class="fA ">Directory rename failed.</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erh"><span class="fA ">File rename failed.</span></a>

The user attempted to rename a directory or file, respectively,
but failed. This could be due to trying to change a read-only
file, trying to change a locked file, or due to some other
error.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__ere"><span class="fA ">Error saving; file/directory may be write protected</span></a>

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage. It can also result from an attempt to overwrite a
read-only file or write to a directory without write
permissions.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erf"><span class="fA ">Error swapping to next world</span></a>

A Robotic command, SWAP to WORLD, was issued, but the stated
world could not be found or otherwise could not be swapped to,
due to version conflicts, file errors, etc.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erg"><span class="fA ">(Filename) already exists.</span></a>

The user attempted to create a new file, but a file with that
name already exists.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__eri"><span class="fA ">Overlay mode is not on (see Board Info)</span></a>

You cannot edit or copy to the Overlay if it is Off; go to
Board Info and turn it to Normal, Static, or Transparent.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erj"><span class="fA ">Save would overwrite older world. Aborted.</span></a>

A save was attempted in the debytecode version of MegaZeux that
would overwrite a non-debytecode world file. Due to the present
instability of debytecode, this is forcibly prevented.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erk"><span class="fA ">Windowing code bug</span></a>

This is an internal error. Try to isolate the reason for the
problem and notify the maintainer(s), as this error signifies a
severe bug in MegaZeux.

<a class="helpanchor" name="ERRORMES.HLP__erl"><span class="fA ">You can only play this game via a swap from another game</span></a>

This error occurs when the user tries to play a game that has
the option set to disallow normal gameplay. The world can only
be played as a swap from another game. For example, this may be
the second half of another game, or a separate world for
showing the introduction.

<a class="helpanchor" name="SENSORSW.HLP__094"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Sensors - What They Are and How to Use Them</span></p>
Sensors have two real purposes. The first is to act as save
points. The second is to interact with Robots as a hybrid of
floor and object. The first use is simple - just set the board
to "Save only on Sensors", and then the player can only save
when standing on a sensor.

The second use is more complex, and requires knowledge of
Robotic. Sensors are like controllable CustomFloors (albeit
CustomFloors that can be pushed by non-player objects). When
creating one, give it a name and a character, then enter the
name of a Robot with which it will interact. This use of sensors
is easily replicable through Robotic now, so this use of sensors
is deprecated. However, if one wants to use sensors, this
information will easily help.

Sensors interact with Robots using labels (messages) and SEND
commands, just like Robots interact with each other. Any Robot
can SEND a message to a sensor, but the sensor will only SEND
messages to the Robot stated in its settings. If you entered a
Robot of ALL, then it will SEND messages to all Robots. Unlike
Robots, sensors cannot send to a dynamic name; for instance, it
cannot be set to send to "&fest&ive" (whereas a Robot would 
properly send to "1ive" when "fest" is 1 and to "5ive" when
"fest" is 5).

<p class="helpcentered">Messages TO Sensors</p>
The following messages can be sent to a sensor. A sensor can
receive messages even when it is beneath the player.

<span class="fE ">DIE</span>

This will cause the sensor to disappear forever.

<span class="fE ">CHAR'X'</span>

This will cause the sensor to change its character to X.

<span class="fE ">CHAR###</span>

This will cause the sensor to change its character to that
represented by the number ###, from 0 to 255.

<span class="fE ">COLORxx</span>

This will cause the sensor to change its color to the color
represented by the code xx, a hexadecimal number from 00 to
FF. The color coding is the same as used for Robotic commands,
except without the "c" character. ?s are not allowed.

<span class="fE ">N</span>
<span class="fE ">S</span>
<span class="fE ">E</span>
<span class="fE ">W</span>

This will cause the sensor to move north, south, east, or west,
respectively. If the player is on top of the sensor, the player
will move along with it. If the sensor tries to move towards
the player, it will instead move beneath. If something pushable
is in the direction of movement, the sensor will push it while
moving if there is room.

<p class="helpcentered">Messages FROM Sensors</p>
Sensors will send Robots the following messages.

<span class="fE ">SENSORON</span>

This is sent when the player steps onto the sensor, when the
sensor is told to move and it ends up beneath the player, or
when something pushes the player onto the sensor.

<span class="fE ">SENSORTHUD</span>

This is sent when the sensor is told to move, but it is blocked.

<span class="fE ">SENSORPUSHED</span>

This is sent when something pushes the sensor.

<p class="helpcentered">Notes on Sensors</p>
Only the player can step onto a sensor; other things will push
it. The sensor, when moving, will move UNDER the player if in
the way, or will take the player with it if the player is on
the sensor. Laying a bomb while on a sensor will destroy the
sensor.

<div class="helpfile" id="COMMANDS.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Command Syntax</span></p>
Commands in Robotic must conform to a certain syntax:

  COMMAND [param] [param] ...

COMMAND is the words or symbol that specifies exactly which
command you are using. Params are the values used to supplement
the command's function.

<span class="fE ">"string" or "counter" or "label" or "Robot" or "file"</span>

Strings are a series of characters surrounded by quotes.
Counters are strings representing the name of a counter. Labels
are strings representing the name of a label, a point within a
Robot. Robots are strings representing the name of a Robot.
Files are strings representing a file or folder on disk, always
including the extension in the case of files. (Some string
examples: "Hi", "Gems", "Label5", "*1230 +725", "robott.txt",
etc.)

The quotes can be left off if the string contains no spaces and
if the string is not the same as any word found in any command
or parameter, i.e. is a word that the editor could not mistake
for a part of a command. MegaZeux will add the quotes for you if
the string meets these criteria. For example, "fifty" and "HONK"
will be auto-completed by MZX, but "Ammo", "N", "Goto", and "You
died" have to have the quotes typed in manually.

<span class="fE ">#</span>

Numbers are allowed to be integers within the range of
-2147483648 to 2147484647. Numbers can be replaced with a string
representing the name of a counter at any time. Examples of
legal numbers: 3200, -79k, .$FA9, "Ammo". They can also be
represented in hexadecimal, using $xxxx format. In this case,
xxxx can be any number from 0 to FFFF.

Numbers can not directly be allowed to go past the 16-bit
limits (-32768 to 32767) in Robotic commands, but this can be
easily circumvented by using constant expressions. Constant
expressions also allow larger hexadecimal numbers and octal
numbers; please view the expressions section for more detail.

Certain commands will limit numbers to the range of 0 to 255.

<a class="helplink" href="#EXPRESS.HLP__exp">Expressions</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP__col"><span class="fE ">[color]</span></a>

The format for colors is cXX, where X is 0-9, A-F, or ?. The
first X represents the background color; the second X represents
the foreground color. The numbers and symbols represent the
following colors, by default:

0 Black       <span class="f0 ">(color #0)</span>
1 Blue        <span class="f1 ">(color #1)</span>
2 Green       <span class="f2 ">(color #2)</span>
3 Cyan        <span class="f3 ">(color #3)</span>
4 Red         <span class="f4 ">(color #4)</span>
5 Purple      <span class="f5 ">(color #5)</span>
6 Brown       <span class="f6 ">(color #6)</span>
7 Lt. Gray    <span class="f7 ">(color #7)</span>
8 Dk. Gray    <span class="f8 bF ">(color #8)</span>
9 Lt. Blue    <span class="f9 ">(color #9)</span>
10 Lt. Green  <span class="fA ">(color #10)</span>
11 Lt. Cyan   <span class="fB ">(color #11)</span>
12 Lt. Red    <span class="fC ">(color #12)</span>
13 Lt. Purple <span class="fD ">(color #13)</span>
14 Yellow     <span class="fE ">(color #14)</span>
15 White      <span class="fF ">(color #15)</span>
? Any color/No change in color

The UI uses its own set of protected colors, to prevent general
color edits from harming usability.

The use of ? is not always a logical option for some commands.
When used, it signifies to replace it with the current color or
ignore that part of the color for that command (or if used in
IF statements, signifies to accept any value in that field).
Colors may be selected from a menu within the Robot editor
using F2. Colors can also be replaced with the name of a
counter at any time. In this case, the value of the counter is
BK*16+FG, where BK and FG are 0-15. To use ?, use the following
values:

   256+FG = c?X
   272+BK = cX?
   288    = c??

A color of c?? will be inserted into commands when you do not
put down anything for the color. Examples of legal colors: cF9,
c02, c?5, c??, "Color".

While detecting colors of ?? is generally an accepted practice,
it's extremely discouraged to put colors of ?? or change to
them, with the exception of Sprites.

<a class="helplink" href="#BADPRACT.HLP__bad">Robotic Usages That Should be Avoided</a>

<span class="fE ">[char]</span>

Characters are a single character surrounded by apostrophes,
e.g. 'X'. X can be any character except #0. A character can be
selected from a menu in the Robot editor using F3. Numbers and
counters can be used to represent characters as well, with
values from 0 to 255 (other values will wrap around to be
0-255). Examples of legal characters - 'a', '&#xE0B1;', 20, "Count".
Characters can also represent numbers, so typing in commands
like INC "health" '5' will most likely yield _much_ different
results than what was likely intended. However, for some usages
this use of chars is vastly superior to any other method (such
as when reading from the overlay onto strings).

Certain characters must be inputted in specific ways to avoid
problems with Robotic:

  \0 for character 0
  \t for tab (character 9)
  \n for newline (character 10)
  \r for carriage return (character 13)
  \" for quotation mark
  \\ for slash
  
MZX handles these conversions for you when using F3.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP__dir"><span class="fE ">[dir]</span></a>

Directions are used to denote a direction on the board. A
direction is one of the following:

  NORTH (or N or UP)
  SOUTH (or S or DOWN)
  EAST (or E or RIGHT)
  WEST (or W or LEFT)
  IDLE
  NODIR
  ANYDIR
  RANDNS
  RANDEW
  RANDNE
  RANDNB
  RANDB
  SEEK
  FLOW
  RANDANY
  UNDER (or BENEATH)

The four cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) are self-explanatory.
Below are descriptions of the other directions.

<span class="fB ">IDLE</span>

No direction, as in the absence of any direction. Used with:

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP___w5"><span class="fA ">WALK [dir]</span></a>

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__con">Conditions</a>

<span class="fB ">NODIR</span>

No directions satisfy the condition. Used with:

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__con">Conditions</a>

<span class="fB ">ANYDIR</span>

Any direction satisfies the condition. Used with:

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__con">Conditions</a>

<span class="fB ">RANDNS</span>

Randomly either NORTH or SOUTH.

<span class="fB ">RANDEW</span>

Randomly either EAST or WEST.

<span class="fB ">RANDNE</span>

Randomly either NORTH or EAST.

<span class="fB ">RANDNB</span>

Randomly any direction where the Robot is not blocked by
something.

<span class="fB ">RANDB</span>

Randomly any direction where the Robot is blocked.

<span class="fB ">SEEK</span>

The direction closest to the player. If the player is on a
diagonal and is equally far away from the Robot vertically and
horizontally, the direction will randomly be one of the two
directions comprising the diagonal.

<span class="fB ">FLOW</span>

The direction that the Robot is currently walking.

<span class="fB ">RANDANY</span>

Randomly one of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST.

<span class="fB ">UNDER</span>

The direction signifying whatever is BENEATH something, such
as floors. Often used with:

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP___l1"><span class="fA ">LAYBOMB [dir]</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP___l2"><span class="fA ">LAYBOMB HIGH [dir]</span></a>

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__con">Conditions</a>

Most directions can be used with the following modifying
prefixes:

<span class="fB ">OPP</span>

The opposite direction. NORTH becomes SOUTH, etc.

<span class="fB ">CW</span>

The direction clockwise of the named direction. NORTH becomes
EAST, etc.

<span class="fB ">RANDP</span>

Randomly a direction perpendicular to the named direction.
NORTH becomes EAST or WEST, etc.

<span class="fB ">RANDNOT</span>

Randomly any direction OTHER than the given direction.

<span class="fE ">[thing]</span>

The name of any object from the editor, other than the player.
Use the name from the object list, minus any punctuation or
spaces. In addition to the things on the lists, you can use
Lazer for any lazer walls shot by lazer guns or Robots, and
OpenGate for a gate that has been opened. Examples of legal
things: Gem, CustomFloor, LitBomb, Robot.

<span class="fE ">[param]</span>

A code representing the settings for a thing. (see above) The
format is p# or p??. # is a hexadecimal code from 0 to FF. ??
represents settings that you don't care about or shouldn't
change. To enter parameter codes easily, use F4 in the Robot
editor after you have typed in an object name. p?? will be
inserted automatically any time you have a thing without a
parameter. Counters can also be used as parameters, as can
decimal numbers; to insert decimal numbers, place the number
in the proper location, but without the "p" before it.

p?? in an IF command will allow that command to accept all
params.

<span class="fE ">[item]</span>

One of the following: TIME, SCORE, GEMS, AMMOS, LIVES, LOBOMBS,
HIBOMBS, COINS, HEALTHS. Note the plural format; this
distinguishes items from things.

<span class="fE ">!<>=</span>

A conditional for comparing two numbers, counters or strings:

= or ==         Equal to
<               Less than
>               Greater than
<= or =<        Less than or equal to
>= or =>        Greater than or equal to
!= or <> or ><  Not equal to

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDS.HLP__con"><span class="fE ">[condition]</span></a>

A word, sometimes followed by a direction, signifying a certain
condition. Use in IF [condition] and IF NOT [condition] commands
to test whether a condition is currently present.

<span class="fB ">WALKING [dir]</span>

Tests whether the Robot is currently walking in a given
direction. IDLE, NODIR, and ANYDIR are allowed here.

<span class="fB ">SWIMMING</span>

Tests whether the Robot is currently in water.

<span class="fB ">FIREWALKING</span>

Tests whether the Robot is currently in either lava or fire.

<span class="fB ">TOUCHING [dir]</span>

Tests whether the player is next to the Robot in the given
direction. NODIR and ANYDIR are allowed here.

<span class="fB ">BLOCKED [dir]</span>

Tests whether the Robot is blocked by something in the given
direction. NODIR and ANYDIR are allowed here. This condition
has a special mode: if the IF command has a REL PLAYER prefix
before it, it will instead check next to the PLAYER for being
blocked. If the IF command has a REL COUNTERS prefix before
it, it will instead check next to the position pointed to by
the counters XPOS and YPOS.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP__pre">REL COUNTERS</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___r2">REL PLAYER</a>

<span class="fB ">ALIGNED</span>

Tests whether the player is aligned with the Robot either
horizontally or vertically.

<span class="fB ">ALIGNEDNS</span>
<span class="fB ">ALIGNEDEW</span>

Tests whether the player is aligned with the Robot, but only
tests on the horizontal (EW) or vertical (NS) axis, not both
at once.

<span class="fB ">LASTSHOT [dir]</span>

Tests whether the last direction the Robot was shot in was
the given direction. For example, if the Robot had just been
shot on the north side, then LASTSHOT NORTH would be true.

<span class="fB ">LASTTOUCH [dir]</span>

Similar to the above; tests whether the last direction the
Robot was touched by the player is the given direction.

<span class="fB ">RIGHTPRESSED</span>
<span class="fB ">LEFTPRESSED</span>
<span class="fB ">UPPRESSED</span>
<span class="fB ">DOWNPRESSED</span>
<span class="fB ">SPACEPRESSED</span>
<span class="fB ">DELPRESSED</span>

Tests whether the indicated key is currently being held down.

<span class="fB ">MUSICON</span>

Tests whether digitized music and sound effects are currently
on.

<span class="fB ">PCSFXON</span>

Tests whether PC speaker sound effects are currently on.

<span class="fE ">Miscellaneous</span>

When typing in a command, the following symbols and words, as
well as spaces, can be used freely. They have no effect on the
final command and are only used to clarify its meaning.

<div class="helpfile" id="STRINGS.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="STRINGS.HLP__1st">Strings, Special Formatting, and Their Place in Robotic</a>

<p class="helpcentered">Simple Strings</p>
Generally, a string is a series of symbols within quotes, such
as: "BUG", "Hi there!", and even "&#xE0C5;&#xE081;EA9 _&#xE00F;&#xE0B1;&#xE0C7;" or "". There are
two special aspects or features of strings that may be useful:
color coding, and counter interpolation.

<p class="helpcentered">Color</p>
Used in Robotic commands *, %, ?, and &, strings can contain
color codes. There are two color symbols: ~ for changing
foreground, and @ for changing background. These should be
followed by one of these characters:

    0 Black (color 0)        8 Dk. Gray (color 8)
    1 Blue (color 1)         9 Lt. Blue (color 9)
    2 Green (color 2)        A Lt. Green (color 10)
    3 Cyan (color 3)         B Lt. Cyan (color 11)
    4 Red (color 4)          C Lt. Red (color 12)
    5 Purple (color 5)       D Lt. Purple (color 13)
    6 Brown (color 6)        E Yellow (color 14)
    7 Lt. Gray (color 7)     F White (color 15)
    

To show a ~, use ~~. To show a @, use @@.

<p class="helpcentered">Counters</p>
Strings can show the values of counters, using the counter name
surrounded with &s. For example, if the player has 55 gems,
"You have &GEMS& gems." will become "You have 55 gems." If you
use &INPUT&, then the last inputted string will be shown. Use &&
to show a true '&'. The above features are available in nearly
ALL Robotic commands that use strings, including in the name of
OTHER counters. (The sole exception is in label names.) This
can be used to simulate array-like constructs.

<p class="helpcentered">Robotic Usage of Strings</p>
In Robotic, strings can be incredibly powerful. They can act
like counters, but hold text information as well as numbers
(however, counters are by far better-suited for number use).
A Robotic string is any counter prefixed by a $ sign (e.g.
"$string").

Certain characters must be inputted in specific ways to avoid
problems with Robotic:

  \0 for character 0 (this won't be parsed correctly in strings)
  \t for tab (character 9)
  \n for newline (character 10)
  \r for carriage return (character 13)
  \" for quotation mark
  \\ for slash

<p class="helpcentered">Robotic Usage - Setting Strings</p>
<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "text"</span>

Sets the given string to the given line of text.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "$string2"</span>

Sets the given string to the contents of another string.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to #</span>

Sets the string to an integer value. Notice that DEC commands
and other similar commands will not work arithmetically with
strings but instead clip and append to the string.

<p class="helpcentered">Robotic Usage - Outputting Strings</p>
Anywhere you can output a counter, you can output a string.
Simply encase the string name in ampersands. E.G.:

<span class="fE ">SET "$woohoo" to "My favorite song!"</span>
<span class="fE ">* "&$woohoo&"</span>

Would output "My favorite song!" in the message line.

There are several special things you can set strings to for
certain functions. These are listed in the Counters section.

<a class="helplink" href="#COUNTERS.HLP__stc">String Counters</a>

<p class="helpcentered">Robotic Usage - Comparing Strings</p>
String comparisons are case-insensitive unless stated otherwise.
Allowed comparisons are to a line of text, to another string and
to a number. However, the string is required to be the first
item, and string counters such as "MOD_NAME", "BOARD_SCAN", etc.
are not valid comparisons.

Strings can be compared through these commands:

<span class="fB ">IF "$string" = "value" then "label" (equality)</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" != "value" then "label" (inequality)</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" > "value" "label" (greater than)</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" < "value" "label" (less than)</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" >= "value" "label" (greater than or equal to)</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" <= "value" "label" (less than or equal to)</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" === "value" then "label" (case-sensitive equality)</span>

Strings can also be compared using wildcards. There are two
special wildcard characters: the ? character in the value being
compared against matches any one character, while the %
character matches any number of any characters (including zero).
The wildcard commands are:

<span class="fB ">IF "$string" ?= "value" then "label"</span>
<span class="fB ">IF "$string" ?== "value" then "label" (case-sensitive)</span>

Due to their use as a token, actual ? and % characters must be
escaped to be checked for in wildcard comparisons. Use \\? and
\\% to have values that check for literal use of these
characters.

<p class="helpcentered">Robotic Usage - Manipulating Strings</p>
Firstly, strings can be offset and limited ("spliced").

<span class="fB ">$strname#X</span><span class="fF "> will cap the string to X characters in length.</span>

<span class="fB ">$strname+X</span><span class="fF "> will offset the start of the string by X</span>
characters. Using a negative number will offset the start of
the string backwards from the end of the string by X characters,
with -1 as the end character. (e.g. "$str+-2" would offset the
string "str" at two characters from its end.)

<span class="fB ">$strname+X#Y</span><span class="fF "> will offset the string by X characters and limit</span>
the string to Y characters in length.

Normally string splicing is used to read a given selection of a
string; however, it can also be used for writing to parts of
strings. When you set an offset when setting a string, the
length of the string will not decrease, so you'll only
manipulate a portion of the string. For instance:

<span class="fB ">set "$str" "hello"</span>
<span class="fB ">set "$str+1" "LOL"</span>

Will cause $str to have the value "hLOLo".

Writing to parts of strings with an offset also changes how the
string limit works; any length cap will limit how much of the
spliced-in material is inserted instead of limiting the string
length in total. For instance:

<span class="fB "> set "$str" "Baby steps."</span>
<span class="fB "> set "$str+0#4" "Long journey."</span>

Will cause $str to have the value "Long steps."

<span class="fB ">$strname.X</span><span class="fF "> will manipulate the Xth character in a string</span>
(starting from 0). When used for output, it will give the
character value of the given character in a string. Any invalid
numbers (past the terminator) are given a value of 0. This
command works well with char immediates: 
E.G. SET "$string.0" 'S' . When setting the character in a
string it will make the string length one larger than X, so be
careful when using very large values.
Using negative numbers will manipulate using the end of the
string as its basis: -X will manipulate the Xth character from
the end of the string, with -1 being the end character.

<span class="fB ">$strname.X#Y</span><span class="fF "> will manipulate characters in the string from the</span>
Xth character (starting from 0), up to character (X+Y-1). Y can
be a number from 1 to 4; all other values for Y are clamped to
fit this range. The string given or output acts as a number 8*Y
bits in length.

<span class="fB ">$str.length</span><span class="fF "> will give the length of the given string.</span>

Secondly, strings can be clipped, appended or written to from
the board or overlay.

<span class="fB ">INC "$string" "$string2"</span>
<span class="fB ">INC "$string" "text"</span>

These two commands append another string's contents or text,
respectively, to the end of a given string.

<span class="fB ">DEC "$string" #</span>

This command clips the given number of characters from the end
of a string. # is treated as unsigned so using negative numbers
will probably cause the length to go down to zero.

<span class="fB ">COPY BLOCK x y w h "$string" t</span>
<span class="fB ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK x y w h "$string" t</span>

These commands copy information from the board or overlay,
respectively, to a given string. X and Y are the coordinates
of the upper-left corner of the block; W and H are its width
and height; T is the terminating character. For T, one can put
in a counter with the param value of the desired terminator
character or a char immediate in the form 'c' (not just the
character itself). If "t" is 0 there will be no terminator.
The letters are added from left to right and up to down until
the terminator character is reached, or until the end of the
given block is reached. If x and y begin with a pound sign (#),
the string will instead be read from the vlayer.
Please use this method of scanning strings instead of
BOARD_SCAN.

<p class="helpcentered">Robotic Usage - File Access</p>
Finally, strings can be used for loading and saving several MZX
file formats. The following formats can be loaded from a string:

-Palettes with <span class="fB ">LOAD PALETTE "$string"</span>
-Charsets with <span class="fB ">LOAD CHAR SET "$string"</span>
-Robots with <span class="fB ">SET "$string" "LOAD_ROBOT"</span>
-MZMs with <span class="fB ">PUT "@$string" image_file pNN x y</span>

Robots can be saved into a string with this command:
<span class="fB ">SET "$string" "SAVE_ROBOT"</span>

MZMs can be saved into a string via these methods:

<span class="fB ">COPY BLOCK x y w h "@$string" p</span>
<span class="fB ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK x y w h "@$string" p</span>
<span class="fB ">COPY (OVERLAY) BLOCK "#x" "#y" w h "@$string" m</span>

String splicing is valid for string file operations.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____3"><span class="fA ">* "string"</span></a>

This command displays the given string as a message on the
message line, which by default is at the bottom of the screen
and centered. Using the newline char (\n) in this string will
cause the message line to span another line underneath, allowing
multi-line messages.

<a class="helplink" href="#STRINGS.HLP__1st">Strings, Special Formatting, and Their Place in Robotic</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____5"><span class="fA ">/ "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___p1"><span class="fA ">PERSISTENT GO "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___g4"><span class="fA ">GO [dir] #</span></a>

Use / followed by a string to move the Robot around the board.
The string must consist of a series of N, S, E, W, and I. NSEW
will move the Robot in that direction, and I will wait for one
cycle. One action is performed each cycle.

Use PERSISTENT GO in the same way as /. However, if the Robot
attempts to move in a given direction and it cannot, the Robot
will wait until it can before moving on to the next symbol.

Use GO to move in a single direction for a given number of
spaces (limited to 255; higher numbers and negatives wrap).

These commands can be used concurrently with <span class="fA ">WALK [dir]</span><span class="fF ">, </span>
allowing Robots to move in double-speed steps. However, this
can only happen when the commands are in the same cycle and if
the given string/number for the moving command is small.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___w5">WALK [dir]</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__dir">Directions</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____6"><span class="fA ">:</span><span class="fA "> "label"</span></a>

A : is used to denote actual LABELS within a Robotic program.
These labels are used as points within the program to branch
to when a Robot receives a message from another Robot, goes to
a label of its own, or otherwise receives an external message.
Label names can be any length and consist of any characters.
They are not case-sensitive, and they can not take interpreted
counters (e.g. : "&label&").
A Robot can have multiple labels with the same name. In these
cases, the topmost of these labels in the Robot's code is the
one that is triggered.
There are several label names that are automatically jumped to
under certain conditions. These are detailed in the Built-in
Labels section.

Labels starting with a pound sign/hash (#) are subroutines.
See the Subroutine section for more information.

<a class="helplink" href="#SUBROUTE.HLP__sub">Subroutines</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#BUILTINL.HLP__1st">Built-in Labels</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___g5"><span class="fA ">GOTO "label"</span></a>

This will attempt to send the current Robot to the label
given; if the label does not exist, this command does nothing.
If the label begins with a # it will go to it as a subroutine.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___g6"><span class="fA ">GOTO "#return"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___g7"><span class="fA ">GOTO "#top"</span></a>

This will send the current Robot to the line after the
next-highest subroutine call and to the line after the first
subroutine call, respectively.

<a class="helplink" href="#SUBROUTE.HLP__sub">Subroutines</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sC"><span class="fA ">SEND "Robot" "label"</span></a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sB"><span class="fA ">SEND # # "label"</span></a>

Use SEND to send another Robot to the label given. This is
called "messaging" a Robot, and the label given is the
"message". The target Robot can be given one of four ways,
as listed above respectively:

1. State the target Robot's name. Use "ALL" in place of the
Robot name to message all Robots (including the Robot doing the
send). Set <span class="fA ">LOCKSELF</span><span class="fF "> beforehand to prevent sending to yourself</span>
when sending to "ALL".
2. State the direction of the target Robot.
3. State the direction of the target Robot, relative to the
player.
4. State the x,y coordinates of the target Robot.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__dir">Directions</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___lA">LOCKSELF</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____9"><span class="fA ">[ "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____2"><span class="fA ">& "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____1"><span class="fA ">% "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____8"><span class="fA ">? "label" "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____7"><span class="fA ">? "counter" "label" "string"</span></a>

Use these commands to bring up a message box during the game
containing the given text. The message box will contain all
consecutive lines using the commands [, &, %, or ?. Blank lines
and labels will be skipped over. The box message commands are
as follows:

  [ will simply display the given message.
  & will display the given message, centered within the box.
  % will display the given message, but will parse color codes.
  ? will display an option that will send the current Robot to
   the given label when selected. If a counter is included, the
   option will only be shown if the counter is NOT zero.

All box-message commands can use ~ and @ color codes, EXCEPT
for [. The advantage of [ is that it will be clipped to 64
characters if it is too long, thereby preventing the display
from being screwed up. The other commands are not clipped and,
if too long, can mess up the current display. (No permanent
damage is done, it just looks bad.)

NOTE: Take care when using any of these commands in a loop (and
be especially vigilant of possible unintended loops). Looping
these commands without any WAITs or similar cycle-breaking
commands (or repeatedly jumping to a label with said command)
can cause the dialogue box to re-appear as soon as it is
closed, making it very hard to resume normal action.

<a class="helplink" href="#COUNTERS.HLP__1st">Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#STRINGS.HLP__1st">Strings, Special Formatting, and Their Place in Robotic</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP____4"><span class="fA ">. "string"</span></a>

This command does nothing. It is used for comments and other
notes you may wish to make within your Robots. There is one
exception - If "string" begins with a @. (see next) You may
comment or de-comment lines of code automatically with the
Ctrl+C command (comment mark). Comments can nonetheless have an
actual effect on code speed, as they must be interpreted when
encountered.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___4b"><span class="fA ">. "@string"</span></a>

If a comment's string begins with a @, then the rest of the
string becomes the new name for the Robot. For example,
"@Hiya" would name the Robot "Hiya". This clips at the first
14 characters of the string; for example, . "@Robothasanewname"
would cut off and rename the Robot "Robothasanewna".

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___e1"><span class="fA ">END</span></a>

This command ends the Robot's program. The Robot will not run
any further commands until an external event affects it.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___d3"><span class="fA ">DIE</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___d4"><span class="fA ">DIE ITEM</span></a>

These commands destroy the Robot forever. DIE ITEM will also
put the player at the location the Robot previously occupied,
which is useful for creating Robots that simulate collectible
items.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___w1"><span class="fA ">WAIT #</span></a>

This command will cause the Robot to do absolutely nothing for
a given number of cycles (limited to 255; values over this will
wrap around). Robots will still respond to label sends when
waiting, provided that the Robot is not locked.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___c9"><span class="fA ">CHAR [char]</span></a>

This command will change the Robot's character (appearance) to
the character given.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___cC"><span class="fA ">COLOR [color]</span></a>

This command will change the Robot's color to the color given.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__col">Colors</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sF"><span class="fA ">SET "counter" #</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sG"><span class="fA ">SET "counter" RANDOM # #</span></a>

These commands set a counter to a certain value. Counters are
internal variables that can be changed through Robots. They are
usually used for custom purposes, although there are many
counters with pre-defined uses as well, such as "Gems". The
RANDOM version will set the counter to a random number within
the given range, inclusive (first number minimum, second
maximum).

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sH"><span class="fA ">SET "$string" "text"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sI"><span class="fA ">SET "$string" "$string2"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sJ"><span class="fA ">SET "$string" number</span></a>

These commands set strings to a certain value: a line of text,
another string or a number, respectively.

<a class="helplink" href="#COUNTERS.HLP__1st">Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___iI"><span class="fA ">INC "counter" #</span></a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___d2"><span class="fA ">DEC "counter" RANDOM # #</span></a>

These commands will increase or decrease a given counter or
string by a given amount. The RANDOM versions will increase or
decrease by a random number within the given range, inclusive
(first number minimum, second maximum).

<a class="helplink" href="#COUNTERS.HLP__1st">Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___i1"><span class="fA ">IF "counter" !<>= # "label"</span></a>

This command tests to see if a given counter is equal to, less
than, etc. another counter or value. If the conditional is met,
the current Robot is sent to the given label. The following
conditionals are allowed- = Equal, < Less than, > Greater than,
<= Less than/equal, >= Greater than/equal, <> (also !=) Not
equal.

<a class="helplink" href="#COUNTERS.HLP__1st">Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___cP"><span class="fA ">CYCLE #</span></a>

This command changes the Robot's speed to one Robot cycle for
every given number of update cycles. An update cycle is how
often everything onscreen is updated, such as most enemies.
Every time a given Robot gets to run commands is called a cycle
in terms of that Robot; most commands can run several times in
a single Robot cycle. (CYCLE # values are limited to 255;
values over this will wrap around.)

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___e6"><span class="fA ">ENDLIFE</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___e5"><span class="fA ">ENDGAME</span></a>

These commands will end the player's current life or the entire
game, just as if the player died or lost all of its lives.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___w5"><span class="fA ">WALK [dir]</span></a>

This will cause the Robot to attempt to move one space in the
given direction every cycle. Use a direction of IDLE to turn
walking off.

This can be used concurrently with <span class="fA ">GO [dir] #</span><span class="fF "> and its</span>
relatives to make Robots move in double-speed steps.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___sT"><span class="fA ">SPITFIRE [dir]</span></a>

These four commands all shoot a weapon in the given direction:
A bullet, a missile, a seeker, or shooting fire, respectively.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__dir">Directions</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___t7"><span class="fA ">TRY [dir] "label"</span></a>

This will have the Robot attempt to move in the given
direction. If it can, it will. If it can't, it will jump to the
given label.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__dir">Directions</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___b1"><span class="fA ">BECOME [color] [thing] [param]</span></a>

The Robot will end its program permanently, and instead become
a specified object with a given color and parameter.
NOTE: Becoming another Robot type will not destroy the program,
but there are far better commands for doing this: <span class="fA ">BECOME</span>
<span class="fA ">PUSHABLE</span><span class="fF "> and </span><span class="fA ">BECOME NONPUSHABLE</span><span class="fF ">.</span>

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__col">Colors</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___b3">BECOME NONPUSHABLE</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___b5">BECOME PUSHABLE</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___c2"><span class="fA ">CHANGE [color] [thing] [param] [color] [thing] [param]</span></a>

All on-board objects of the first given type will become
objects of the second given type.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__col">Colors</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___pC"><span class="fA ">PUT [color] [thing] [param] # #</span></a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___pF"><span class="fA ">PUT [color] [thing] [param] [dir] PLAYER</span></a>

This will put a given object somewhere onscreen. If anything
else is in that spot and layer, it will be replaced with this
object. (The exception is if the player is in the target
location. In this case, nothing happens.) The target location
can be given in one of three ways:

1. State the target x,y coordinates.
2. State the direction, relative to the Robot.
3. State the direction, relative to the player.

Note that this command is not suitable for placing Robots. For
moving a Robot, use <span class="fA ">GOTOXY # #</span><span class="fF ">; for placing a copy of a Robot,</span>
use <span class="fA ">DUPLICATE SELF # #</span><span class="fF "> or </span><span class="fA ">DUPLICATE SELF [dir]</span><span class="fF ">.</span>

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDS.HLP__dir">Directions</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___m3"><span class="fA ">MOD "file"</span></a>

This command loads the given module/OGG/SAM file as background
music. These files also can be loaded from a subdirectory with
the syntax of ""dir"\"file"" or ""dir"/"file"" (without the
inner quotes). The biggest difference between MOD and SAM
commands is that for a file loaded with MOD one can use related
commands like VOLUME and MOD ORDER; the music loops as well.
NOTE: placing * at the end of the filename will set the current
mod to the given filename, but institute MOD "*" (see below) for
subsequent board visits.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___m8"><span class="fA ">MOD "*"</span></a>

Sets the board's currently running music to "wildcard". This
means that it will continue to play whatever was last playing.
This setting does not "lock" the board's music to any one song;
for instance, if 1.mod was playing on the last board, mod "*"
will continue playing 1.mod, but if the player then goes to a
board playing 2.mod and jumps back to the mod "*" board from
there, 2.mod will continue playing, and 1.mod will not start.

Plays the given SAM/WAV/OGG/module file at a given frequency.
These files also can be loaded from a subdirectory with the
syntax of ""dir"\"file"" or ""dir"/"file"" (without the inner
quotes). 0 plays the file at natural frequency. Music loaded
with the SAM command will not loop.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___m9"><span class="fA ">MODULO "counter" #</span></a>

Multiplies, divides, or performs a modulo on the value of the
given counter by the given number (rounding down), and then sets
the counter to the result.
To modulo is to set to the remainder when dividing. Example: 7
modulo 3 is equal to 1, since 7 divided by 3 gives a remainder
of 1.

NOTE: The modulo command may output different numbers compared
to the modulo expression function; they may act differently
when negative numbers are involved. For the modulo command, the
output will give results similar to when both numbers are
positive, but will simply have the sign of the dividend (i.e. a
truncated modulo).

other notes currently playing, while PLAY will add its notes to
the end of the current sound effects queue. WAIT PLAY will wait
until the queue is almost empty before adding its notes.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___cE"><span class="fA ">COLOR FADE IN</span></a>

Fades the palette out to black or in to full color. Fading in
will not work if you haven't faded out, and fades affect
neither the current palette nor current intensities.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___g8"><span class="fA ">GOTOXY # #</span></a>

The Robot will go to the given x,y coordinates on the current
board, destroying anything there that cannot go on the under
layer. If the player is at those coordinates, the Robot ignores
the command.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___a1"><span class="fA ">ABORT LOOP</span></a>

These three commands define a loop, which is a sequence of
commands to be repeated. LOOP START marks the start of a loop.
LOOP # will loop back to LOOP START the given number of times.
ABORT LOOP will jump out of the loop, to the command after LOOP
#. The loop count is kept in the local counter "loopcount".
Make sure your number in LOOP # is one less than the amount for
which you actually want to loop, as the initial iteration
before first hitting LOOP # is not counted in the number.

NOTE: Using ABORT LOOP outside of the loop (that is, outside of
any block of code starting with LOOP START and ending in
LOOP #) is very highly unadvised and will most likely cause
unintended effects.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___u3"><span class="fA ">UNLOCKSELF</span></a>

Locks or unlocks, respectively, the current Robot. When a Robot
is locked, no external messages will be acknowledged - Only
internal GOTOs, etc. will be processed. (Built-in label calls
to "thud" and "edge" are exceptions.)

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___v3"><span class="fA ">VOLUME #</span></a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMANDR.HLP___cO"><span class="fA ">COPYROBOT [dir]</span></a>

The current Robot becomes an exact duplicate of the noted
Robot, starting from the beginning of the noted Robot's code.
Note that if the source Robot was previously ended with the END
command, or was at the end of its program, the destination
Robot will be in an ended state as well. The Robot to copy can
be stated in one of three ways:

1. State the target Robot's name.
2. State the x,y coordinates of target Robot.
3. State the direction of target Robot.

NOTE: Exact means just that, EXACT, down to the values of
local counters. The only thing that will differ will be the
robot_id. If one requires an group of objects differing only in
name, COPYROBOT is generally unsuitable for this purpose because
even the Robot name is copied.

Attempts to give keys to or take keys from the player. The

otherwise they will do nothing. The forms with labels will jump
to the labels if the Robot tries to give a key when the player
has no room for keys, or if the Robot tries to take a key the

Gives or takes a number of a certain item. If the player does
not have enough of this type of item to take, nothing is taken.
The third form jumps to a given label if the player doesn't have
enough of the stated item.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___t6"><span class="fA ">TRADE # [item] # [item] "label"</span></a>

Gives the player a number of the first item and takes a number

enough of the second item, this command jumps to the given label
and has no other effect. This command eases the writing of
simple shops and vendors.

Keep in mind that trades involving healths and lives can end up
with either at 0, leading to potential deaths and endgames if
the player has the exact amount of health/lives being traded
away.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___l6"><span class="fA ">LOCKPLAYER</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___l9"><span class="fA ">LOCKPLAYER NS</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___l8"><span class="fA ">LOCKPLAYER EW</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___l7"><span class="fA ">LOCKPLAYER ATTACK</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___u1"><span class="fA ">UNLOCKPLAYER</span></a>

The first four commands lock the player, preventing the player
from doing any moving and attacking (i.e. default shooting and
bombing), from moving north or south, from moving east or west,
or from attacking, respectively. The fifth command will clear
all locks on the player, allowing free movement and attacking.
These have no relation to the Board Info options "Can Bomb" and
"Can Shoot". Player locking is local, only affecting the
current board.

Locking the player will also prevent messages related to locked
actions from showing (such as bomb switch messages or a "Can't
{shoot/bomb} here!" message when the player is attack locked).

Also, locking the player will not cause the relevant input to
be ignored completely. MegaZeux will still detect that you are
pressing keys, even if the Player is forbidden from responding
to them, and will act accordingly. In short, even if a player
is locked, Robots that take directional and space/delete inputs
will still act the same.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___b7"><span class="fA ">BOARD [dir] "string"</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___b8"><span class="fA ">BOARD [dir] NONE</span></a>

Changes the board exit in the given direction to lead to the

<a class="helplink" href="#STRINGS.HLP__1st">Strings, Special Formatting, and Their Place in Robotic</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___z1"><span class="fA ">ZAP "label" #</span></a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP____0"><span class="fA ">| "label"</span></a>

ZAP will scan the Robotic program from the top down, changing
a given number of instances of the stated label to ZAPPED
labels. A ZAPPED label is inactive - it cannot be jumped to or
sent to under any circumstance. This has two uses: It will
prevent interference from a certain outside event, and it
allows multiple instances of the same label. For example, you
could have four SHOT labels in a row, ZAP one each time the
Robot was shot, and jump back to normal code, but have a fifth
SHOT label lead to an explosion.

RESTORE will scan the Robotic program from the bottom up,
changing a given number of the stated ZAPPED labels back to a
normal label. Essentially, this means that the most recently
ZAPPED labels are restored first. Both ZAP and RESTORE can have
a number larger than the number of instances of the stated
label. The final command, |, is a pre-ZAPPED label, allowing you
to have labels in your Robotic programs that are already ZAPPED
and inactive.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP__pre"><span class="fA ">REL COUNTERS</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r2"><span class="fA ">REL PLAYER</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r3"><span class="fA ">REL SELF</span></a>

These are special types of commands, called PREFIXES. Prefixes
don't do a thing by themselves, but when placed before another
command that uses x,y coordinates, they change the origin of the
x,y coordinate system for that ONE following command. REL
COUNTERS moves the origin to the x,y location stated in the
counters XPOS and YPOS. REL PLAYER moves the origin to the
x,y of the player. REL SELF moves the origin to the x,y of the
current Robot.

The movement of the origin changes the (0,0) coordinates from
the upper left of the board to somewhere else, effectively
adding that x,y position to any coordinates entered. For 
example, if the Robot is at the (5,5) position and uses REL
SELF on the coordinates (2,2), it will effectively act on
coordinates (7,7). If the player is at the (7,2) position and a
Robot uses REL PLAYER on coordinates (-3,6), the Robot will
effectively act on coordinates (4,8).

Let's look at some examples.

<span class="fE ">PUT c0E GEM p?? 5 5</span>

This places a gem at the x,y coordinates (5,5).

<span class="fE ">REL PLAYER</span>
<span class="fE ">PUT c0E GEM p?? 5 5</span>

This places a gem 5 spaces to the right and 5 spaces below
where the player currently is, or at the board edge if it is
under 5 spaces to the right/below the player.

<span class="fE ">REL SELF</span>
<span class="fE ">PUT c0E GEM p?? -2 -3</span>

This places a gem 2 spaces to the left and 3 spaces above
where this Robot currently is, or at the board edge if it is
under 2 spaces to the left or 3 spaces above the Robot.

<span class="fE ">REL COUNTERS</span>
<span class="fE ">PUT c0E GEM p?? 1 -4</span>

This places a gem at the coordinates (XPOS+1,YPOS-4), or on a
board edge if either of these coordinates would extend past the
board. XPOS and YPOS are counters with amounts defined by the
user before using this command.

Prefixes only have an effect on the very next command. This
includes comments.

Prefixes also affect two other things. The built in counters
THISX and THISY will be offset by a prefix, and the command
IF [dir] BLOCKED will check next to the player or next to the
position noted by the counters, if a prefix is present. See
these for details.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r4"><span class="fA ">REL COUNTERS FIRST</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r5"><span class="fA ">REL PLAYER FIRST</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r6"><span class="fA ">REL SELF FIRST</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r7"><span class="fA ">REL COUNTERS LAST</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r8"><span class="fA ">REL PLAYER LAST</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___r9"><span class="fA ">REL SELF LAST</span></a>

These prefixes are similar to the above prefixes, but they only
affect the first or last x,y pair of coordinates in the next
command. For example, COPY accepts two pairs of coordinates. If
you precede it with the following:

REL PLAYER FIRST
REL SELF LAST

Then the coordinates of the object being copied will be relative
to the player, and the destination coordinates will be relative
to the Robot. There is one other difference with these commands
- REL COUNTERS FIRST works off of the counters FIRSTXPOS and
FIRSTYPOS, and REL COUNTERS LAST works off of the counters
LASTXPOS and LASTYPOS.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___j1"><span class="fA ">JUMP MOD ORDER #</span></a>

The current module jumps to the stated module order, if
applicable. For example, JUMP MOD ORDER 3 will begin playing
the third order in the module, which is the fourth section of
the module. Sometimes your music editor will refer to this as
the 'Pattern' or 'Track'.
With OGG music, this command makes a jump to the stated frame.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___sW"><span class="fA ">SWITCH [dir] [dir]</span></a>

Copies the thing at one location to another, with the location
stated through x,y coordinates or directions relative to the
current Robot. The third command will swap the things in the
two directions.

COPY can copy between different layers by using the appropriate
prefixes. Prefix coordinate numbers with "+" to indicate
overlay coordinates, and with "#" to indicate vlayer
coordinates.

NOTE: DO NOT normally use COPY # # # # to copy Robots; use
DUPLICATE SELF or COPYROBOT. It is useful for copying by Robot
id, however; use COPY rN.thisx and rN.thisy as the first pair
of coordinates.

Using COPY # # # # on a Robot will no longer cause the Robot
copy to start where the parent left off, and will have new
Robots start at the first line.

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___cL"><span class="fA ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK # # # # # #</span></a>

Copies a block of things from one location on the board or

upper-left corner of the block to be copied, the second two
numbers state the size of the block, and the third two numbers
state the destination block's upper-left corner.

COPY BLOCK and COPY OVERLAY BLOCK can copy from board to
overlay and from overlay to board (respectively). The last two
numbers must be prefixed by plus signs, like so:

COPY BLOCK # # # # "+#" "+#"

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___cX">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK # # # # "#x" "#y"</a>

These commands copy from the board or overlay (respectively) to
the vlayer. The first two numbers are the x,y coordinates of the
upper-left corner of the block to be copied; the next two
numbers are the respective width and height of the block; the
"#x" and "#y" are the x,y coordinates of the destination block's

This command copies a block from the vlayer and copies it onto
a different spot on the vlayer. "#x1" and "#y1" are the x,y
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the copied block; the
next two numbers are the respective width and height of the
copied area; "#x2" and "#y2" are the x,y coordinates of the
destination block's upper-left corner. The pound sign in #x1",

These commands copy from the board or overlay (respectively)
to an MZM. The first two numbers are the x,y coordinates of the
block's upper-left corner; # # is the respective width and
height of the block; filename is the name of the file - the @
is required. Finally, the last number determines the MZM type.
1 saves as layer; 0 saves as board. 0 is integral for copying
non-graphical data (primarily Robots); 1 is proper for copying
graphical data, as the block's appearance will stay as exactly
as it was when saved.

are the x,y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the block;
the third and fourth are its respective width and height; the
last is the terminating character's char value (i.e. a number

<a class="helpanchor" name="COMMAND2.HLP___l5"><span class="fA ">LOAD PALETTE "file"</span></a>

Loads in the specified character set or palette, exported using
Alt+X from the world editor. The new character set or palette
is permanent and affects the entire world until a new one is
loaded. These files also can be loaded from a subdirectory with
the syntax of ""dir"\"file"" or ""dir"/"file"" (without the
inner quotes).

Character sets can be loaded to the middle of the current
charset by prefixing the "file" name with +offset, where offset
is a hexadecimal number, or @offset where offset is a decimal
number. Up to 14 additional charsets can be loaded for use with
unbound sprites. To set and access these, set the decimal
offset number to (256*extra charset number); hexadecimal
offsetting cannot access additional charsets. Naturally,
offsets within these charsets can be set as well by adding the
desired offset value to these numbers.

These commands can also take string inputs in place of
hard-coded filenames.

There are three different types of bullets in MegaZeux: Player,
Enemy, and Neutral. The player shoots Player bullets, enemies
shoot Enemy bullets, and ricocheted bullets become Neutral
bullets. A Robot can shoot any type of bullet, according to its
BULLETTYPE counter, but it defaults to Neutral bullets.
 
All fired Enemy bullets, even those shot from Robots, become
Neutral bullets when the option "Enemies' bullets can hurt
enemies" is set. Only pre-placed Enemy bullets will remain Enemy
bullets in this case.

Player bullets can only hurt enemies. Enemy bullets can only
hurt the player. Neutral bullets can hurt either. Robots go to
different labels when shot with each one, or to a generic SHOT
label if there are none of the specific PLAYERSHOT, ENEMYSHOT,
or NEUTRALSHOT labels.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">CHANGE CHAR ID - The CHAR ID Table</span></p>
The CHAR ID table has many uses. The first area of usage - the
CHANGE CHAR ID # [char] command - basically changes the value
(a character, color, or number) of a given type of item. These
values correspond to the Global Chars or Damage tables from
Global Info. The first number in the command states what is to
change. (Note - if noted, the number corresponds to a color or
damage. Otherwise, it is a character.) These numbers are also
listed next to things in the Global Edit Chars menus.

The second area - using the BOARD_ID, BIDx,y or UIDx,y counters
- will change an actual item instead of that entry's value;
i.e. these counters transform the actual item (and ONLY that
item) at a specific pair of coordinates from one type to
another.

WARNING: Changing certain CHAR ID values will have decidedly
special effects:

<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF ">Changing the value of any Custom type will turn ALL of that</span>
type into the given character; same with text.
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF ">There is a special exception to this, though. If the value is</span>
(char) 255, then all items of that type act like Custom objects
and assume a character based on their parameter (e.g. p01
objects will use character 1). This can allow built-ins of the
same type that display different characters in-game at the same
time. Some built-ins may show interesting effects if set to
this, such as gaining animation frames.
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF ">Changing the CHAR IDs of objects with animations or four</span>
directional characters will fix ALL animations/chars of that
object type to the given character.
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF ">It is inadvisable to use any UNUSED values.</span>
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF ">Using CHAR ID to change between actual items only works</span>
with values <122. For example, changing something into Ice by
setting BOARD_ID to 160 will not work, but setting BOARD_ID to
25 will. However, there is no such restriction with changing
CHAR ID table values using CHANGE CHAR ID.
<span class="fA ">*</span><span class="fF ">Damage values start at 327. Not all values are listed, because</span>
technically you can assign damage values for things that cannot
give damage (i.e. pretty much everything not listed in the
table). If you really want to manipulate damage values for such
items, to find the CHAR ID number for an item, just add 327 to
it.

To change a character, use the following form:

<span class="fA ">CHANGE CHAR ID # [char]</span>

# is the number corresponding to the character that you want to
change, or a counter representing that number. [char] is the
character (or counter representing the character) that you wish
to change it to.

To change a color, use the following form:

<span class="fA ">CHANGE CHAR ID # [color]</span>

# is the same as above, but corresponding to a color. [color]
is the color or a counter representing the color that you wish
to change it to.

To change damage values, use a number or counter in place of
the [char] or [color].

After typing in a [color] or damage value, it may change to a
character representation, but the value will still remain the
same.

To change line characters:

Take the base number for the type of line you wish to change
(128 for thin, 144 for thick) and add one of the following
values to represent which sides are connected via other web or
lines:

0  -
1  N
2  S
3  N S
4  E
5  E N
6  E S

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Built-in Labels</span></p>
Robotic has many built-in labels (messages) that are activated
on certain external events. Each label, and what triggers it,
is listed below.

Subroutine versions of most labels exist. If a built-in label
has a subroutine version, [#] will be listed to the right of
its name. If both forms exist, they will both be triggered,
with the subroutine version being triggered first, and the
normal version triggered as the subroutine is left.

Special care is required when dealing with built-in subroutine
labels; to prevent abuse of the stack, using LOCKPLAYER and/or
ZAP to keep subroutine calls to an absolute minimum is highly
advised. Subroutines themselves are explained in another
section.

<a class="helplink" href="#SUBROUTE.HLP__sub">Subroutines</a>

<span class="fE ">TOUCH [#]</span>

This is sent when the player touches the Robot, that is, when
the player is next to it and tries moving into it. If the player
is locked in that direction, this label is not sent.

<span class="fE ">THUD [#]</span>

This is sent when the Robot is walking and it runs into a
non-pushable obstacle. This label is not sent when the obstacle
is hit during a <span class="fE ">GO [dir] #</span><span class="fF "> or the </span><span class="fE ">/ "string"</span><span class="fF "> command. THUD</span>
ignores LOCKSELF. This label will be constantly triggered if the
condition persists.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___w5">WALK [dir]</a>

<span class="fE ">EDGE [#]</span>

This is sent when the Robot is walking and it runs into the
edge of the board. If EDGE is not found, the Robot is sent to
THUD. This label is not sent when the edge of the board is hit
during the <span class="fE ">GO [dir] #</span><span class="fF "> or the </span><span class="fE ">/ "string"</span><span class="fF "> commands. EDGE</span>
ignores LOCKSELF. This label will be constantly triggered if the
condition persists.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___w5">WALK [dir]</a>

<span class="fE ">BOMBED [#]</span>

This is sent when the Robot is hit with an explosion.

<span class="fE ">KEY? [#]</span>

This is sent when the player presses the given key. ? should be
replaced with the key to be scanned for. Characters a to z and 0
to 9 work as expected. Shifted alphabetic characters will NOT
work, and will actually scan as their non-shifted counterparts.
Any other character that can be outputted directly, such as ";"
or "*" or "=", will work, and "key " will detect the space bar.
Other characters can be entered by pressing F3 and selecting
them from the grid, but they are usually not guaranteed to work.
Special-case characters that can work with KEY? are character 8
(BackSpace), character 9 (Tab), character 27 (Esc), character
127 (Delete) and character 13 (Enter, though there's a better
label just for this mentioned in the very next entry).

There is another way to scan for key presses: using counters.
They are called KEY_PRESSED, KEY, and KEY_CODE, and are detailed
in the Miscellaneous Counters section of the help file.

<a class="helplink" href="#COUNTERS.HLP__msc">Miscellaneous Counters</a>

<span class="fE ">KEYENTER [#]</span>

This is sent when the player presses the Enter key.

<span class="fE ">INVINCO [#]</span>

This is sent when the player grabs an energizer.

<span class="fE ">PUSHED [#]</span>

This is sent when a pushable Robot is pushed by something other
than the player.

<span class="fE ">ENEMYSHOT [#]</span>
<span class="fE ">PLAYERSHOT [#]</span>
<span class="fE ">NEUTRALSHOT [#]</span>

One of these is sent when the Robot is shot, correlating to the
type of bullet used. If the appropriate label is not found, the
Robot is sent to SHOT instead.

<span class="fE ">SHOT [#]</span>

This is sent when the Robot is shot by a bullet and the more
specific label cannot be found.

<span class="fE ">PLAYERHIT [#]</span>

This is sent when the player is shot with a bullet. If not
found, the Robot is sent to PLAYERHURT instead.

<span class="fE ">PLAYERHURT [#]</span>

This is sent when the player is hurt by anything other than a
bullet. Bullets send the Robot to PLAYERHIT, and only send it
to PLAYERHURT if PLAYERHIT cannot be found.

<span class="fE ">SPITFIRE [#]</span>

This is sent when the Robot is hit with shooting fire.

<span class="fE ">JUSTLOADED</span>

This is sent when the world was just loaded or restored from a
saved game. This is also sent upon swapping worlds; in that
case, it will only trigger if no JUSTENTERED label is set.

<span class="fE ">JUSTENTERED</span>

This is sent when the board was just entered or the world was
just started on this board. This is also sent upon swapping
worlds; in that case, if no JUSTENTERED label is set,
JUSTLOADED is triggered instead.

<span class="fE ">SENSORON</span>

This is sent by a Sensor when it is stepped upon by the player,
or the Sensor moves beneath the player.

<a class="helplink" href="#SENSORSW.HLP__094">Sensors</a>

<span class="fE ">SENSORTHUD</span>

This is sent by a Sensor when it tries to move and is blocked.

<a class="helplink" href="#SENSORSW.HLP__094">Sensors</a>

<span class="fE ">SENSORPUSHED</span>

This is sent by a Sensor when it is pushed by something.

<a class="helplink" href="#SENSORSW.HLP__094">Sensors</a>

<span class="fE ">LAZER [#]</span>

This is sent when the Robot is hit with a lazer.

<span class="fE ">GOOPTOUCHED [#]</span>

This is sent when the player touches Goop.

<span class="fE ">YES</span>

This is sent when the YES button is selected in an ASK box.

<span class="fE ">NO</span>

This is sent when either the NO button is selected in an ASK
box, or when ESC exits an ASK box.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters</span></p>
Counters are built-in variables, or stored values with names.
Each counter has a name, such as "Yellow" or "Apple Pies" or
even "100". A counter can hold a value from -2147483648 to
2147483647, in most cases. A counter is "active" when it has a
value other than 0. There can be a practically unlimited amount
of active counters at any one time, in addition to the built-in
counters. Counters retain values between different boards.

Local counters, on the other hand, only hold their values for
one Robot. These are useful because multiple Robots can set
local counters with the exact same names without causing
conflicts. There are several local counters explicitly reserved
for use; these are the "local" & "local2" through "local32"
counters.

To display a counter's number, enclose the counter in
ampersands. (e.g. &counter&). This displays the counter value
in decimal. Sometimes hexadecimal is needed, like in certain
MegaZeux commands. To output a counter number in hex, add a
+ to the front of the enclosed counter (e.g. &+hexcount&).
Lastly, other MegaZeux commands might require a two-digit
hex number; for these, add a # to the front of the enclosed
counter (e.g. &#twodigithex&). Note that in this case, only the
two most significant digits will be used (e.x. the number
'abcdef' becomes 'AB') and single-digit numbers will gain a
trailing zero (e.x. the number '8' will become '08').

Also, characters can be used as counters in commands. For
example: SET "boom" to '0' would come out as SET "boom" to 48.
It's quite a difference!

The following is a list of built-in counters, which all have
special meanings. There are four types of built-in counters:
Global, which affect everything; Local, which are different for
each Robot and require special handling for other Robots to
manipulate; Board, which are specific to the current board; and
Universal, which persist for the entire time MegaZeux is
running. Some built-in counters are read-only; a few are
write-only.

MegaZeux utilizes a large number of built-in counters to
maximize flexibility. For this reference, they have been
divided into distinct sections.

<p class="helpcentered">Player Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__ply"> </a>
<span class="fB ">GEMS, AMMO, LOBOMBS, HIBOMBS, COINS, LIVES, HEALTH</span>

These contain the current number of the stated item that the
player currently has.

<span class="fB ">INVINCO</span>

The number of cycles of invincibility the player currently has.

<span class="fB ">SCORE</span>

The player's current score.

<span class="fB ">PLAYERLASTDIR</span>

The last direction the player moved: 0 for none, or 1 2 3 4 for
N S E W. Used to determine ice slippage and certain other
effects.

<span class="fB ">PLAYERFACEDIR</span>

The direction the player is facing: 0 1 2 3 for N S E W. Used
to determine which player character to display.

<span class="fB ">PLAYERX (read-only)</span>
<span class="fB ">PLAYERY (read-only)</span>

The x or y coordinate of the player, respectively.

<p class="helpcentered">Robot Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__rob"> </a>
<span class="fB ">PLAYERDIST (read-only, local)</span>

The distance from the Robot to the player, in spaces. The sum
of HORIZPLD and VERTPLD.

<span class="fB ">HORIZPLD (read-only, local)</span>
<span class="fB ">VERTPLD (read-only, local)</span>

The horizontal or vertical distance from the Robot to the
player, in spaces.

<span class="fB ">THISX (read-only, local)</span>
<span class="fB ">THISY (read-only, local)</span>

The current X or Y coordinate of the Robot. Affected by
prefixes - If a command that uses THISX and THISY is prefaced
with a REL PLAYER command, THISX and THISY will be generated
based on the player's current position. For example, if the
player is at (2,2) and the Robot is at (5,5), THISX and THISY
will be 3. If the player is at (8,8), THISX and THISY will be
-3. If a command that uses THISX and THISY is prefaced with
a REL COUNTERS command, THISX and THISY will be generated
based on XPOS and YPOS. Basically, THISX and THISY will be
set to THISX-XPOS and THISY-YPOS.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP__pre">REL COUNTERS</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___r2">REL PLAYER</a>

<span class="fB ">BULLETTYPE (local)</span>

The current type of bullet shot by the Robot: 0 for Player, 1
for Neutral, and 2 for Enemy. Technically, this counter can
hold any number from 0 to 255, but only 0, 1 and 2 have
defined behavior. The others essentially set the Robot to shoot
Enemy bullets, if actually used to affect shot bullets.

<a class="helplink" href="#BULLETTY.HLP__1st">Bullet Types</a>

<span class="fB ">COMMANDS</span>

The number of commands executed per Robot cycle (40 is default).
This number is global. It can severely slow MegaZeux if set too
high and coupled with poor coding (especially busy loops lacking
cycle-ending commands).

<span class="fB ">LOOPCOUNT (local)</span>

The counter used for looping commands in Robotic - LOOP START,
LOOP #, and ABORT LOOP.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___lC">LOOP START</a>

<span class="fB ">ROBOT_ID (read-only, local)</span>

The internal ID of the Robot.

<span class="fB ">RID<Robot name> (read-only)</span>
<span class="fB ">ROBOT_ID_<Robot name> (read-only)</span>

Both of these give the robot_id number of the given named
Robot. In the case of multiple robots with the same name, the
ID number corresponds to only one of them (the one with the
largest robot_id). If no robots have the name, or if the name
in question only belongs to the global Robot, -1 is given.

BEWARE: The existence of this counter makes it impossible to
use words which start with "rid" as counters. The port will NOT
fall through and give the values of any counter that starts
with "rid"; instead, it ends at -1 (since the Robot the counter
is trying to find, like "dles" (for "riddles"), will most
likely not exist). Older games will allow this, but only for
compatibility reasons.
<a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__rnc"> </a>

<span class="fB ">Rn.<counter></span>

Contains the value of the given counter (without the angle
brackets) in the Robot with the robot_id number n. If no Robot
exists with this robot_id, the counter will return -1.

<span class="fB ">THIS_COLOR (read-only, local)</span>
<span class="fB ">THIS_CHAR (read-only, local)</span>

The current color and character of the Robot, respectively.

<span class="fB ">LAVA_WALK (local)</span>

Controls whether the Robot can walk on lava or not. Setting
this to 1 is the equivalent of using the BECOME LAVAWALKER
command. Setting it to 0 is the same as BECOME NONLAVAWALKER.
Like BULLETTYPE, this counter can hold any value from 0 to 255,
but only 0 and 1 have defined behavior. This was a popular
local counter before the local counters were plentiful, as most
Robots didn't deal with lava.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___b4">BECOME LAVAWALKER</a>

<span class="fB ">LOCAL (local)</span>
<span class="fB ">LOCAL2 (local)</span>
..
<span class="fB ">LOCAL32 (local)</span>

The non-special local counters each Robot can use. In effect,
any number can be used, not just 2-32; the counter accessed by
it would be N%32 (so, for example, any change to "local0" would
have the same effect as changing "local32"). LOCAL is the same
as LOCAL1.

<span class="fB ">GOOP_WALK (local)</span>

Controls whether the Robot can walk on goop or not. A value of 0
prevents walking on goop; a non-zero value allows it. This
counter has an effective range of 0 to 255.

<p class="helpcentered">Board Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__brd"> </a>

<span class="fB ">BOARD_ID</span>

Reads or alters the CHAR ID value of the object located at
"board_x" "board_y".

<a class="helplink" href="#CHANGECH.HLP__1st">CHANGE CHAR ID - The CHAR ID Table</a>

<span class="fB ">BOARD_PARAM</span>

Reads or alters the parameter of the object located at
"board_x" "board_y".

<span class="fB ">BOARD_W (read-only, board)</span>
<span class="fB ">BOARD_H (read-only, board)</span>

The current board's width and height, respectively.

<span class="fB ">TIME (board)</span>

The current timer value, between 0 and the time limit for the
current board. If there is no time limit set, setting this
counter will cause the timer to tick down but turn off after it
runs out.

<span class="fB ">TIMERESET (board)</span>

The time limit for the current board. 0 for no time limit.
NOTE: This timer was erroneously called "TIMERSET" in some
versions. MZX will NOT use TIMERSET as a synonym for this
counter in current versions.

<span class="fB ">SCROLLEDX (read-only, board)</span>
<span class="fB ">SCROLLEDY (read-only, board)</span>

The top-left corner of the screen's x or y coordinates,
respectively.

<span class="fB ">BOARD_X (board)</span>
<span class="fB ">BOARD_Y (board)</span>
<span class="fB ">BOARD_COLOR (read-only, board)</span>
<span class="fB ">BOARD_CHAR (read-only, board)</span>

Set BOARD_X and BOARD_Y to the x,y coordinates of a cell on the
current board, and BOARD_COLOR and BOARD_CHAR will automatically
hold the color and character values for that cell, respectively.

One thing to note is that BOARD_COLOR will not take background
color 0's transparency into account. For example, assuming
default colors, if a white-on-black Robot walks onto a
yellow-on-blue floor tile, the Robot appears as white-on-blue on
the screen, but this counter will still report it as
white-on-black instead of the displayed colors.

<span class="fB ">BCHx,y (read-only, board)</span>

Allows the reading of single characters to the board with
regards to coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">BCOx,y (read-only, board)</span>

Allows the reading of single colors to the board with regards
to coordinates x,y; the comma must be included. Much like
BOARD_COLOR, BCOx,y will not take transparency into account.

<span class="fB ">BIDx,y (board)</span>

Allows reading and writing of the CHAR ID of an object on the
board at the coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">BPRx,y (board)</span>

Allows reading and writing parameter values of an object on the
board at the coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">UCHx,y (read-only, board)</span>

Allows the reading of single characters on the under layer at
the coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">UCOx,y (read-only, board)</span>

Allows the reading of single colors on the under layer at the
coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">UIDx,y (board)</span>

Allows reading and writing of the CHAR ID of an object on the
under layer at the coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">UPRx,y (board)</span>

Allows reading and writing parameter values of an object on the
under layer at the coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

All of the above four under layer counters will fail if any
floor-type object (fake, floor, carpet, ice, lava, etc) is
currently occupying the board layer at the given coordinates.

<span class="fB ">OVERLAY_X (board)</span>
<span class="fB ">OVERLAY_Y (board)</span>
<span class="fB ">OVERLAY_CHAR (read-only, board)</span>
<span class="fB ">OVERLAY_COLOR (read-only, board)</span>

These work in the same way as the BOARD_xxx counters above, but
deal with the overlay instead.

<span class="fB ">OCHx,y (read-only, board)</span>

Allows the reading of single characters on the overlay at the
coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">OCOx,y (read-only, board)</span>

Allows the reading of single colors on the overlay at the
coordinates x,y; the comma must be included.

<span class="fB ">OVERLAY_MODE (read-only, board)</span>

Shows the state of the overlay. 0 is off, 1 is normal, 2 is
static and 3 is transparent.

<span class="fB ">MOD_FREQUENCY (board)</span>

Controls the frequency (in Hz) of the currently playing module/
OGG music. Note that this value is NOT saved by save files, so
if necessary, it needs set again after a save gets loaded.

<a class="helplink" href="#SOUNDEFX.HLP__frq">SAM, OGG, MOD and WAV Frequencies</a>

<span class="fB ">MOD_ORDER (board)</span>

Controls the current mod order of the currently playing mod.

<span class="fB ">MOD_POSITION (board)</span>

Controls the current row in tracked modules, or the current PCM
sample in OGGs.

<span class="fB ">MOD_LENGTH (read-only, board)</span>

Displays the length of the currently playing mod. This counter's
value shows number of rows for module files and number of
samples for OGG files.

NOTE: This counter will not work if MegaZeux was built with the
Mikmod engine. This is a minor concern due to Mikmod never being
the default module engine for MegaZeux.

<span class="fB ">MOD_LOOPSTART</span>
<span class="fB ">MOD_LOOPEND</span>

These counters control looping in the currently-playing music.
MOD_LOOPSTART marks the beginning position of a loop;
MOD_LOOPEND marks the end. If MOD_LOOPEND is 0, no looping will
occur. Despite the counter names, they do not work on tracked 
modules, only OGG files.

<span class="fB ">MINx,y</span>

Takes the numbers x and y and outputs the smaller number. The
comma is required.

<span class="fB ">MAXx,y</span>

Takes the numbers x and y and outputs the larger number. The
comma is required.

<span class="fB ">MULTIPLIER</span>

<span class="fB ">FREAD_OPEN (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">FWRITE_OPEN (function)</span>

Opens a file for reading from or writing to, respectively. The
syntax is as such:

set "file.ext" to "FREAD_OPEN"

FREAD_OPEN will also read subdirectories with the given syntax:

set "dir" to "FREAD_OPEN"

<span class="fB ">FWRITE_MODIFY (function)</span>

This opens an existing file for reading without overwriting it,
starting at the beginning of the file.

<span class="fB ">FWRITE_APPEND (function)</span>

This opens a file for writing at the END of the file. Note that
all FWRITE_POS functionality is ignored in this mode.

<span class="fB ">FREAD_COUNTER (function)</span>

Reads four bytes from the open file.

<span class="fB ">FWRITE_COUNTER (function)</span>

Writes four bytes to the open file.

NOTE: The above two counters will have different functionality
in worlds made before MZX 2.82 (in the old implementation, they
use two bytes and are unsigned). This is purely for
compatibility reasons.

<span class="fB ">FREAD_POS</span>
<span class="fB ">FWRITE_POS</span>

The current reading or writing position of the accessed file.
0 is the beginning position; when no file is loaded, the
relevant counter is -1. If set to -1, the position is set to the
end of the file.

<span class="fB ">FREAD_DELIMITER</span>
<span class="fB ">FWRITE_DELIMITER</span>

The character considered the terminator for fread and fwrite
operations, respectively.

<span class="fB ">FWRITE (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">FREAD (function)</span>

Respectively writes to and reads from the open file. With
counters, these counters only write/read a single byte at a
time; with strings, FWRITE will write a full string and tack the
terminator character to the end, and FREAD will read a full
string up to the terminator.

<span class="fB ">FWRITEn (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">FREADn (function)</span>

Respectively writes to and reads from the open file, but will
limit action to n number of characters. These counters only work
with strings, not with counters, and will neither place nor
respect terminator characters.

<span class="fB ">FREAD_LENGTH</span>

Returns the length in characters of the open file in read mode.
If this file does not exist, returns -1. If a directory is open,
returns the number of items (files and subdirectories) in that
directory.

<span class="fB ">FWRITE_LENGTH</span>

Returns the length in characters of the open file in write mode.

<span class="fB ">SAVE_ROBOT (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">LOAD_ROBOT (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">SAVE_ROBOTn (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">LOAD_ROBOTn (function)</span>

Saves or loads Robotic code to or from plaintext files,
respectively. The first forms save/load the current Robot,
while the second forms save/load the Robot with the Robot ID of
the number n.

One can also load a string as a Robot instead of a text file, or
save a Robot into a given string.

<span class="fB ">SAVE_BC (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">LOAD_BC (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">SAVE_BCn (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">LOAD_BCn (function)</span>

Saves or loads Robotic code to or from bitcode files,
respectively. The first forms save/load the current Robot,
while the second forms save/load the Robot with the Robot ID of
the number n.

Keep in mind that due to slated changes in MegaZeux, saving out
Robots (in either text or bytecode form) is considered a
deprecated function and may be removed entirely in the future.

<span class="fB ">SAVE_GAME (function)</span>
<span class="fB ">LOAD_GAME (function)</span>

Saves or loads MZX savegames, respectively.

<span class="fB ">SAVE_COUNTERS (function)</span>

<p class="helpcentered">Sprite Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__spc"> </a>

<span class="fB ">SPR_CLISTn (read-only)</span>

A list of flagged collisions after a collision test was
performed. Values of n from 0 to (SPR_COLLISIONS - 1) are
valid. If the foreground collided, SPR_CLIST0 is always set to
-1 to indicate this.

<span class="fB ">SPR_COLLISIONS (read-only)</span>

The number of sprite/foreground collisions listed in
SPR_CLISTn.

<span class="fB ">SPR_NUM</span>

When using p?? for placing a sprite, this counter's value
becomes the sprite's parameter. When IF c?? Sprite p?? X Y is
used, SPR_NUM will be set to the number of the first sprite that
makes the IF statement true (if there are any). The sprites are
checked by sprite number in ascending order.

<span class="fB ">SPR_YORDER (write-only)</span>

If set to 1, the sprites are drawn in order of lowest sum of
SPRn_Y and SPRn_CY values to highest instead of in order of
their sprite numbers. Any incidence of matching sums will have
draw order determined by sprite number. If any SPRn_Z values are
set, those take precedence.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_CCHECK (write-only)</span>

If set to 1 for sprite n, overlapping char 32s will not cause a
collision between that sprite and other sprites or the
foreground. If set to 2, char 32s and blank chars will also not
collide, and blank characters will not be drawn. If set to 3,
the given unbound sprite will undergo pixel-precise collision
checks, and transparent colors will not cause a collision.
Setting to 0 will cancel any previously set ccheck modes for
that given sprite.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_CWIDTH</span>
<span class="fB ">SPRn_CHEIGHT</span>

The dimensions of the collision box around sprite n. (X and Y
dimensions, respectively)

<span class="fB ">SPRn_CLIST (write-only)</span>

Setting this counter to any value will perform a collision test
on sprite n against its current location.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_CX</span>
<span class="fB ">SPRn_CY</span>

The location, relative to sprite n's upper left corner, of the
sprite's collision box (X and Y coordinates, respectively).
These have default values of 0.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_OFF</span>

If set to any value, turns sprite n off if it is on.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_OVERLAID (write-only)</span>
<span class="fB ">SPRn_OVERLAY (write-only)</span>

If either is set to 1, these draw sprite n over the overlay as
opposed to underneath. Note that this has different behavior
depending on whether unbound sprites are present. If there are
any unbound sprites active, all overlaid sprites will be drawn
above all non-overlaid sprites (as well as over the overlay).
If unbound sprites are not in use, overlaid sprites will be
drawn above the overlay, but will otherwise respect the standard
sprite draw order.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_REFX</span>
<span class="fB ">SPRn_REFY</span>

Where sprite n's appearance is stored - either on the board or
the vlayer (see SPRn_VLAYER). REFX is the x-coordinate, REFY is
the y-coordinate. Whatever this looks like at this position is
what the sprite will look like when drawn, including the colors
if c?? is used when placing the sprite.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_SETVIEW (write-only)</span>

Setting this to 1 will cause the viewport to be centered around
sprite n. This is not a permanent effect, but a one-time jump
akin to the RESETVIEW command. This is useful for scrolling the
screen for (e.g.) a sprite-based player object.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_STATIC (write-only)</span>

If set to 1, makes sprite n act static (like a static overlay, a
static sprite always stays in a given position on the screen);
if this is 0, the sprite scrolls with the board.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_SWAP (write-only)</span>

Swaps sprite n with the sprite number to which this function is
set.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_VLAYER (write-only)</span>

If set to 1, sprite n is referenced from the vlayer instead of
the board.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_WIDTH</span>
<span class="fB ">SPRn_HEIGHT</span>

The dimensions of sprite n. (x and y dimensions, respectively.)

<span class="fB ">SPRn_X</span>
<span class="fB ">SPRn_Y</span>

The current position of sprite n. These can be used to set the
sprite outside the edges of the board, whereas PUT c?? Sprite
p?? X Y disallows this.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_Z</span>

These counters allow a user-defined sprite draw order. This
method of determining draw order takes precedence over
SPR_YORDER and sprite number. Higher SPRn_Z values are higher
priority and will be drawn over sprites with lower SPRn_Z
numbers. Matching SPRn_Z values will fall back to SPR_YORDER
precedence if active, and sprite number precedence otherwise.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_UNBOUND</span>

If set to 1, unbinds sprite n from the grid, making its
coordinates refer to pixel positions instead of tile positions.
Its dimensions (SPRn_HEIGHT, SPRn_WIDTH) and reference
coordinates (SPRn_REFX, SPRn_REFY) will still be relative to
tiles, but its current position (SPRn_X, SPRn_Y) and collision
box counters (SPRn_CX, SPRn_CY, SPRn_CWIDTH, SPRn_CHEIGHT) will
adhere to this change. See the Unbound Sprites section in the
Sprites help for more information.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_TCOL</span>

Sets which color provides transparency for unbound sprite n.
Setting to -1 disables transparency for that sprite. Defaults to
0.

<span class="fB ">SPRn_OFFSET</span>

Internally alters any number that refers to a character for
sprite n. In the case of unbound sprites, this number will often
be a multiple of 256 in order to access an extra charset, but
offset values within char sets may also be used.

<a class="helplink" href="#SPRITES.HLP__spr">Sprites</a>

<p class="helpcentered">String Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__stc"> </a>

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "BOARD_NAME"</span>

Sets the given string to the name of the current board.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "BOARD_SCAN"</span>

Sets the given string to a line of characters read directly
from the board starting at "board_x" "board_y" and terminating
at an asterisk (char 42), any instance of char 0, or after 63
characters (whichever comes first). This command is
deprecated; please use copy block to strings instead.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "INPUT"</span>

Sets the given string to any input placed for the "input
string" command.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "MOD_NAME"</span>

Sets the given string to the filename of the currently playing
module.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "ROBOT_NAME"</span>

Sets the given string to the name of the Robot this command
is in.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "FREAD"</span>
<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "FREADn"</span>

Sets the given string to the contents of the currently open
file. FREAD stops at the terminator (*, or char 42, by default)
or at the end of the file. FREADn reads the first n characters
from the file. You can use FREAD with the #N string splicing
format to read up to N characters while still terminating on
the terminator.

<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "FWRITE"</span>
<span class="fB ">SET "$string" to "FWRITEn"</span>

Places the contents of the given string into the currently open
file. FWRITE places the entire string, ending it with the
terminator character (*, or char 42, by default), while FWRITEn
only places the first n characters. If n goes over the string's
length, the entire string (and nothing else like whitespace or
garbage characters) will be placed.

<p class="helpcentered">Super MZX Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__szc"> </a>

<span class="fB ">SMZX_MODE</span>

Determines whether Super MZX mode is off (0), 1, 2, or 3. All
other values wrap around these four (so, for instance, trying to
set SMZX_MODE to 4 would set it to 0, and trying to set
SMZX_MODE to -1 would set it to 3).

<span class="fB ">SMZX_Rn</span>
<span class="fB ">SMZX_Bn</span>
<span class="fB ">SMZX_Gn</span>

Changes or reads the value of color n's red/blue/green value,
respectively. These counters range from 0-63; numbers outside
these bounds wrap around. These counters also work outside of
SMZX modes; in normal mode, using numbers 0-15 for n alters the
current palette.

<span class="fB ">SMZX_IDXx,y</span>

Reads or sets the color of a tile with a given color x's yth
color. For example, <span class="fE ">SET "SMZX_IDX191,0" to 50</span><span class="fF "> would set the</span>
color number of the base color (color 0 out of 0-3) of a c1a
(color 191) tile to color 50. This applies to SMZX mode 3 only,
and only to renderers that support unbound sprites.

Keep in mind that all re-ordered indices will be set to normal
values when SMZX_MODE is changed.

<span class="fB ">SMZX_INDICES (function)</span>

Loads SMZX indices files. This only applies for SMZX Mode 3.

<span class="fB ">SMZX_MESSAGE</span>

Controls whether messages in the message line are displayed with
SMZX characters and colors in SMZX modes. 1 is yes, 0 is no
(displays in normal mode); the default value is 1.

<span class="fB ">SMZX_PALETTE (read-only)</span>

Loads a Super MZX palette. This counter is deprecated; please
use load palette instead.

<p class="helpcentered">Character Edit Counters</p><a class="helpanchor" name="COUNTERS.HLP__cha"> </a>

<span class="fB ">CHAR_X</span>
<span class="fB ">CHAR_Y</span>
<span class="fB ">PIXEL</span>

Set CHAR_X and CHAR_Y to a pixel location in the char set. You
can then set the PIXEL counter to one of the following to edit
the pixel:

  0 Turns the pixel OFF
  1 Turns the pixel ON
  2 Toggles the pixel

You can also read the counter to see the current state of the
chosen pixel. A value of 1 denotes that the pixel is set, and 0
if not.

The pixel location system works on a 32 x 8 grid of characters,
exactly like the 'Select Character' grid. Each character
consists of fourteen rows of eight pixels, which gives us 256
pixels across by 112 pixels down. Since we start counting at 0,
the top-left pixel of the top-left character (char 0) would be
0,0. The bottom-right pixel of the bottom-right character
(char 255) would be 255,111.

These counters become useless in SMZX modes.

<a class="helplink" href="#CHAREDIT.HLP__079">The Character Editor</a>

<span class="fB ">CHAR_BYTE</span>
<span class="fB ">CHAR</span>
<span class="fB ">BYTE</span>

Set CHAR to a character (0-255) and BYTE to one of the fourteen
bytes within the char (0-13). You can then read or write that
byte using the CHAR_BYTE counter. Char_byte values range from
0-255, and the meaning of each char_byte setting changes between
normal mode and SMZX modes. Normal MZX graphics mode sets bytes
in binary (base 2); SMZX modes use quaternary (base 4).

These counters can also edit the extra character sets unbound
sprites use by setting CHAR to the character numbers of the
extra sets (e.g. 256 for the first char of the first extra set).

It helps to write the number in binary/quaternary first, then
convert to decimal. Writing the numbers this way helps
demonstrate that whatever is desired to be set is set. The
values per pixel decrease going left to right.

Examples:

(Normal MZX mode, setting the third, fifth and seventh pixel)

Binary: 00101010

&#xE0DA;---&#xE0C2;--&#xE0C2;--&#xE0C2;--&#xE0C2;-&#xE0C2;-&#xE0C2;-&#xE0C2;-&#xE0BF;
|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
&#xE0C3;---&#xE0C5;--&#xE0C5;--&#xE0C5;--&#xE0C5;-&#xE0C5;-&#xE0C5;-&#xE0C5;-&#xE0B4;
|  0| 0| 1| 0|1|0|1|0|
&#xE0C0;---&#xE0C1;--&#xE0C1;--&#xE0C1;--&#xE0C1;-&#xE0C1;-&#xE0C1;-&#xE0C1;-&#xE0D9;

Decimal: ((128*0)+(64*0)+(32*1)+(16*0)+(8*1)+(4*0)+(2*1)+(1*0))
         = 42

Notice that the binary number shows which pixels are on, in
order.

(Super MZX Mode, setting first and second pixel to color 2,
third to color 4 and fourth to color 1)

Quaternary: 1130

&#xE0DA;--&#xE0C2;--&#xE0C2;-&#xE0C2;-&#xE0BF;
|64|16|4|1|
&#xE0C3;--&#xE0C5;--&#xE0C5;-&#xE0C5;-&#xE0B4;
| 1| 1|3|0|
&#xE0C0;--&#xE0C1;--&#xE0C1;-&#xE0C1;-&#xE0D9;

Decimal: ((64*1)+(16*1)+(4*3)+(1*0)) = 92

Much like the binary numbers for normal MZX mode, the
quaternary number shows what color each pixel is in order.
Here, color values range from 0 to 3.

If this counter is set to a non-zero value, the current
MegaZeux world will exit to the title screen. This counter does
nothing on the title screen unless in standalone mode, and if
standalone mode is ran without a title screen, this counter will
cause MegaZeux to exit entirely.

<span class="fB ">PLAY_GAME</span>

If this counter is set to a non-zero value when MZXRun is in
standalone mode and on the title screen, the game will be
started. Instances outside of the title screen and outside of
MZXRun will be ignored.

<span class="fB ">CURRENT_COLOR</span>
<span class="fB ">RED_VALUE</span>
<span class="fB ">GREEN_VALUE</span>
<span class="fB ">BLUE_VALUE</span>

When CURRENT_COLOR is set between 0 and 15 (between 0 and 255
in Super MZX modes), the other three counters contain the red,
green and blue values of that color.

<a class="helplink" href="#PALEEDIT.HLP__093">The Palette Editor</a>

<span class="fB ">INPUT (board)</span>

The numerical value of the last string inputted in an INPUT
STRING box.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___iP">INPUT STRING "string"</a>

<span class="fB ">INPUTSIZE (board)</span>

The size, in characters, of the last string inputted in an INPUT
STRING box.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___iP">INPUT STRING "string"</a>

<span class="fB ">DATE_DAY (read-only, universal)</span>
<span class="fB ">DATE_MONTH (read-only, universal)</span>
<span class="fB ">DATE_YEAR (read-only, universal)</span>

Contain the current day, month and year respectively, based on
the system clock.

<span class="fB ">TIME_HOURS (read-only, universal)</span>
<span class="fB ">TIME_MINUTES (read-only, universal)</span>
<span class="fB ">TIME_SECONDS (read-only, universal)</span>
<span class="fB ">TIME_MILLIS (read-only, universal)</span>

Contain the current hour, minute, second and millisecond
respectively, based on the system clock, in 24-hour format.

<span class="fB ">INT</span>
<span class="fB ">BIT_PLACE</span>
<span class="fB ">INT2BIN</span>

Used to manipulate bits within a counter. Set INT to the number
or counter you wish to edit. Set BIT_PLACE to a number between
0 and 15 (which correspond to the bits in a 16-bit signed
counter), and then set INT2BIN to one of the following to edit
the bit:

  1 Sets the bit ON
  2 Sets the bit OFF
  3 Toggles the bit

The edited value is placed into the INT counter. You can also
read the INT2BIN counter to see the current state of the bit.

This method of bit manipulation is heavily deprecated in favor
of expressions (especially considering it only works on 16 bits
instead of the current 32). Follow the link below to read more.

<a class="helplink" href="#EXPRESS.HLP__exp">Expressions</a>

<span class="fB ">KEY_PRESSED (read-only)</span>
<span class="fB ">KEY</span>
<span class="fB ">KEY_CODE (read-only)</span>

KEY_PRESSED lists whether any key (each referenced by a number)
is currently being held down; for example, on a typical
keyboard, if the spacebar is being pressed the value of
key_pressed will be 32. This set of keycodes is the same as the
ones required for joystick support. Results are unsigned, so
checking for negative numbers will not work. "Autorepeat stall"
affects KEY_PRESSED, so if you hold down a key you will get the
value, then get zeros for a period, then get the values again.
This is useful for many applications.
KEY acts like KEY_PRESSED, but lacks autorepeat stall, returns
uppercase letter values, and retains its value until another key
is pressed.
KEY_CODE acts similar to KEY_PRESSED but has different keycodes.
Its keycode set is more limited, making KEY_PRESSED generally
preferable.

<span class="fB ">KEYn (read-only)</span>
<span class="fB ">KEY_RELEASE (read-only)</span>

KEYn checks whether the key with the keycode n is pressed; 1
means yes, 0 means no. KEY_RELEASE tests whether a key is
released. These display/use the same keycodes as KEY_CODE, but
do not cause an autorepeat stall. Results are unsigned, so
checking for negative numbers will not work.

<span class="fB ">RANDOM_SEED0 (universal)</span>
<span class="fB ">RANDOM_SEED1 (universal)</span>

These counters allow reading and controlling MegaZeux's random
seed. RANDOM_SEED0 controls the low 32 bits of the seed, while
RANDOM_SEED1 controls the high 32 bits. The random seed is not
retained by save files.

<span class="fB ">MAX_SAMPLES</span>

Sets number of samples that can play at once. -1 sets no limit,
0 mutes all samples; -1 is the default setting. The actual
sample limit will be the smaller of the limit set by this
counter and the limit set by the max_simultaneous_samples config
file setting. PC Speaker emulated sounds are unaffected.

<span class="fB ">XPOS</span>
<span class="fB ">YPOS</span>

The X or Y-coordinates (respectively) used by the REL COUNTERS
command.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP__pre">REL COUNTERS</a>

<span class="fB ">FIRSTXPOS</span>
<span class="fB ">FIRSTYPOS</span>

FIRST command.

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMAND2.HLP___r4">REL COUNTERS LAST</a>

<span class="fB ">LASTXPOS</span>

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Using the Editor</span></p>
The Robotic editor is quite simple to use. After selecting your
Robot's character and name, you will enter the editor screen.
There are three major sections to the editor screen: The top
box, showing current statistics; the middle box, showing the
Robot's program with the current line highlighted in the
center; and the bottom box, showing the available editing
commands.

To edit the Robot, you enter lines just as in editing scrolls.
Use up and down or PageUp and PageDown to scroll between lines,
and use Enter at the end of a line to insert new blank lines.
Pressing Enter in the middle of a line will remove everything
to the right of the cursor and place it onto a new, following
line. Press Backspace at the beginning of a line to place its
contents onto the preceding line (this be ignored if there is
not enough space).

After you enter a line, it will be checked for proper syntax.
If it passes, it will be reformatted and redisplayed, and you
can then enter another line; if it does not, it will be marked
as ignored. The reformatting is unpreventable - Since MegaZeux
tokenizes Robotic lines to conserve space, all irrelevant
information such as extra spaces is lost. The editor attempts
to print the lines in a visually pleasing manner.

All lines other than the current line will have the various
elements such as strings and numbers highlighted in different
colors. cXX-type color codes will be shown as their actual
color. The current line is shown in a solid color and color
codes are shown in the usual cXX format.

The following keys are active within the Robotic editor:

insert a cXX color code into the current line corresponding to
that color.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___cr"><span class="fE ">F3 - Character</span></a>

F3 will bring up a menu of characters. Select one and press
Enter to insert that character into the current line. No quotes
or apostrophes are added.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___dr"><span class="fE ">F4 - Parameter</span></a>

If you have just typed in the name of a thing, such as Ammo,
F4 will allow you to select settings for it in order to insert
a pXX parameter code.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___er"><span class="fE ">F5 - Char Edit</span></a>

Use F5 to insert series of numbers corresponding to character
pictures, for use with the Robotic CHAR EDIT command.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___fr"><span class="fE ">F6-F10 - Macro</span></a>

F6 through F10 will insert short macros, customizable using
Alt+O. If you have an extended macro set for these an input
window for it will come up (see Configure Macro for more
details).

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___gr"><span class="fE ">F12 - Take Screenshot</span></a>

Pressing F12 will make a 640x350 screenshot (in PNG format by
default) in the working directory, using the software renderer.
The file naming starts from "screen0".

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___hr"><span class="fE ">Alt+B OR Alt+Enter - Block Action</span></a>

Allows you to perform an action on the current block of lines.
Possible actions are: Copy to the OS's clipboard, Cut to the
OS's clipboard (copy it and then delete it), Clear from memory,
or Export to a text file on disk. If no block is currently
highlighted, the actions will take effect on the current line.
Alt+Enter is the old and deprecated hotkey, left in to ease use
for long-time users.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___nr"><span class="fE ">Alt+S OR Alt+Home - Mark Block Top</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___ir"><span class="fE ">Alt+E OR Alt+End - Mark Block End</span></a>

Alt+S/E will mark the top or bottom of a block of lines. You
can then perform various block actions on these lines. The
marked lines are highlighted. Alt+Home and Alt+End are the old
and deprecated hotkeys, left in to ease use for long-time
users.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___jr"><span class="fE ">Alt+H - Hide Help / Borders</span></a>

Alt+H toggles the horizontal borders and help key reference.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___kr"><span class="fE ">Alt+I - Import</span></a>

Use Alt+I to import a text file or bytecode file into the
current Robot. The new lines will be inserted into the current
program, starting from the current line.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP__lr_"><span class="fE ">Alt+M - Configure Macro</span></a>

Alt+M will load a box where you list the name of an extended
macro to be configured (for example, type "1" to edit macro_1).
After choosing a macro to edit, you will be able to set the
various variables for the macro. Select OK to place the macro,
Cancel to go back to the editor without placing the macro, and
Default to change all values to their defaults.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___mr"><span class="fE ">Alt+O - Edit Single Line Macros</span></a>

You can change the values of the five single-line macros here.
Use ^ for Enter in the macros. If there is an extended macro in
place of macros 1-5, it will override any single-line macro also
set for that macro.

<a class="helplink" href="#CONFGINI.HLP__1st">The Config File</a>

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___or"><span class="fE ">Alt+U - Unmark Block</span></a>

The current block is unmarked.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___pr"><span class="fE ">Alt+V - Verify</span></a>

Use Alt+V to determine if there are any invalid lines in the
robot, and if there are what their errors are. Each invalid line
can be set to I (ignore), D (delete) or C (comment), which will
be applied if the user selects OK. Only the first 256 errors
will be listed.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___qr"><span class="fE ">Alt+X - Export</span></a>

Use Alt+X to export either the current block or the entire
Robot program to a text file or bytecode file on disk. If saved
as text, one can then edit the program outside of MegaZeux or
use the text file in other ways.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___rr"><span class="fE ">Alt+BackSpace - Delete Entire Line</span></a>

The currently selected line is blanked. The empty line itself
will remain.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___sr"><span class="fE ">Alt+Ins OR Alt+P - Paste</span></a>

Alt+Ins or Alt+P will paste in the block last copied to the
internal clipboard. The clipboard used is the OS clipboard, and
as such is preserved between Robots and even between worlds.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___tr"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+F - Search</span></a>

Use Ctrl+F to activate the Search menu. After inputting a string
to find in the Search box and choosing options, the Robotic
editor will search for the term starting from the current line
and jump to the first string that matches.
Wrap will ensure every line of the code is checked (otherwise
all code above the current line will be ignored) and Case
Sensitive will require the search string and the results match
case exactly before giving results.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP__+ur"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+H - Replace</span></a>

Use Ctrl+H to activate the Replace menu. The Search box takes
the text to be changed, and the Replace box takes the text that
replaces it. Replace only changes the first seen instance of the
searched text, with the search starting from the current line.
Replace All changes all of them at once. Once completed, the
Robotic editor will jump to the last line changed by a replace
action (if any).
Wrap will ensure every line of the code is checked (otherwise
all code above the current line will be ignored) and Case
Sensitive will require any string matching the search string to
also match case before being replaced.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___vr"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+R - Repeat Search/Replace</span></a>

Use Ctrl+R after a Search or Replace action to repeat the
action.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___wr"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+G - Goto Position</span></a>

Use Ctrl+G to jump to the given Robotic line/column (if too
high of a number is given, the editor will jump to the last
possible line/column).

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___xr"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+I/D/C - Mark Line</span></a>

These commands mark the current invalid line as to be ignored,
deleted, or commented out upon editor exit, respectively. If
the line is valid Ctrl + C will turn it into a comment
(truncating the end of the line if commenting would make the
line exceed 241 characters). Note that comment-marking a
comment will immediately strip the line.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___yr"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+BackSpace - Delete Previous Word</span></a>

Use Ctrl+BackSpace to delete the word to the left of the cursor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___zr"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+LeftArrow - Jump to Previous Word</span></a>

Use Ctrl+LeftArrow to jump to the beginning of the previous
word in the current line.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___1r"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+RightArrow - Jump to Next Word</span></a>

Use Ctrl+RightArrow to jump to the beginning of the next word
in the current line. If on the last word of the line, this
command jumps to the end of the line.

<a class="helpanchor" name="USINGTHE.HLP___2r"><span class="fE ">Esc - Exit Robotic Editor</span></a>

This key will exit the Robotic Editor, unless any lines are
marked as invalid.

The statistics line across the top of the Robot editor shows
the current line number, the current column within the line, the
size of the Robot program versus the maximum size this Robot can
reach, and the Robot's X/Y position.

Use ESC to exit the Robot editor when you are done editing your
Robot program.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Robots - What They Are and How to Use Them</span></p>
Robots are the heart and soul of MegaZeux. Nearly anything you
could want to do in MegaZeux - anything you see done in a
MegaZeux game, many things you didn't know were possible - can
be done with MegaZeux's Robots.

Robots are programmed in their own programming language, called
Robotic. Robotic is a fairly simple language to learn, but
somewhat moderate to completely master. It is somewhere along
the lines of BASIC, although more complex. If you've ever used
Epic Megagame's ZZT, Robotic is vastly more complex than
ZZT-OOP, although there are vague similiarities. There's a
kludge or dozen to get really powerful things working, but
you'll get used to them.

To place a Robot in the editor, press F10 and select Robot. (You
can also select Pushable Robot if you want things to be able to
push the Robot.) Then name the Robot and select a character to
represent it. You are then brought to the Robot editor, where
you can program the Robot in Robotic.

Robots are limited to the board, and there can be 255 of them on
each board. They can be pretty large - 2MB in size, enough code
space to create extraordinarily complex (or convoluted)
programs. There is an exception: the Global Robot, which is
outside of the board and runs at all times.

<div class="helpfile" id="ROBOTICT.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="ROBOTICT.HLP__1st"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Robotic Tutorial</span></p>
Robotic has a few concepts that you must understand before you
begin to program in it. You can skip this if you want, but it
will help you learn Robotic much faster. A large portion of
this will be obvious to anybody who has ever programmed in any
language or used computers extensively.

<p class="helpcentered">Commands</p>
You can have one command per line. A command is an instruction
to MegaZeux or the Robot telling it to do something. A program
is a series of commands that are ran right after another.

<p class="helpcentered">Parameters</p>
A parameter is the part of the command that can change, such
as numbers or colors. They specify how the command should be
run or what it should affect. For example, in the command:

WAIT 6

WAIT is the command, and 6 is the parameter. Many commands have
multiple parameters. Parameters are often specified using #,
"string", or [color] [char], etc.

<p class="helpcentered">Labels</p>
A label is a point in a Robotic program that has been given a
name. It is used as a reference point so the Robot can return
to that point at any time, to allow actions like repeating
sections of commands (looping) or reactions to certain events.
Labels are written as follows - : "label"

<p class="helpcentered">Messages</p>
A message is something one Robot sends to another, or an
external event sends to a Robot, to tell it to do something.
This involves jumping to the label corresponding to that
message. For example, a Robot can tell another Robot to
"Bounce"; That Robot will now be executing commands starting
at the label : "Bounce" .

<p class="helpcentered">Coordinates</p>
x,y coordinates are a pair of numbers representing a point on
the current board. (0,0) is the upper-left corner of the board,
and the first coordinate increases while going right, while the
second increases while going down. You can find coordinates
easily at the bottom of the screen when help is hidden, by
pressing Alt+Y, or by pressing F6 in the game (only in editor
playthroughs). x,y coordinates can be negative, but this is
uncommon and used for special purposes only (e.g. using REL
commands).

<p class="helpcentered">Strings</p>
A string is a series of letters or characters, inside quotes.
For example, "STRING", "Booga!", "-21_Trees-", or "[[]]".

<p class="helpcentered">Characters</p>
A character is a single symbol, letter, number, punctuation
mark, space, graphic, etc. All things are viewed as single
characters. When using single characters in Robotic, they must
be enclosed in apostrophes- e.g. 'X'. Certain characters must
be inputted in specific ways to avoid problems with Robotic:

  \0 for character 0 (this won't work in strings, but will work
  for single chars)
  \t for tab (character 9)
  \n for newline (character 10)
  \r for carriage return (character 13)
  \" for quotation mark
  \\ for slash

<p class="helpcentered">Colors</p>
A color is a code representing a background/foreground color
pair. They follow the format cXX, where X is 0-9, A-F or ?
(which stands for any color). To enter color codes easily, use
F2 in the Robot editor. The exact format of color codes is
covered in another section.

A quirk to keep in mind: any entity with a background color of 0
will display the background color of anything beneath it.

<p class="helpcentered">Directions</p>
Directions represent one of the four cardinal directions of
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST. They can be abbreviated to N, S,
E, and W. There are other directions, but these are the most
commonly used.

Hopefully you understood the above material, as knowledge of it
is essential to program in Robotic. If you don't quite grasp
it, you can return to it later, but you will need to understand
it eventually.

<p class="helpcentered">Your First Robotic Program: HELLO WORLD!</p>
First, open the Editor and create a Robot. Then open the
Robot's programming box by pressing Enter twice while the Robot
is highlighted.

Now, type the following into the editor:

<span class="fE ">* "HELLO WORLD!"</span>
<span class="fE ">end</span>

Here's what each line does.

<span class="fE ">* "HELLO WORLD!"</span>

The * command puts whatever text is in the parentheses on the
bottom of the screen. (Actually, it's placed on the given
message line row, which is the bottom by default.) All Robotic
code starts immediately, so this particular statement happens
right as the board with this Robot is loaded.

<span class="fE ">end</span>

This ends the code. It is good practice to include the END
command even when you don't think you need it; leaving the END
command out can cause some problems such as text glitches or,
worse, the running of any and all code after where you want
your Robot to stop!

That was really simple, wasn't it? Now let's step up to
something a bit bigger.

<p class="helpcentered">Your Second Robotic Program</p>
Create a Robot in the editor, and give it the following
program:

 <span class="fE ">: "start"</span>
 <span class="fE ">GO NORTH 2</span>
 <span class="fE ">GO SOUTH 2</span>
 <span class="fE ">GOTO "start"</span>

Now test the world. As you can see, this program makes the
Robot move up and down. Let's analyze it line by line.

<span class="fE ">: "start"</span>

As we know, this is a label. It marks the beginning of the
program.

<span class="fE ">GO NORTH 2</span>

This quite plainly tells the Robot to move north two spaces.

<span class="fE ">GO SOUTH 2</span>

This tells the Robot to move south two spaces.

<span class="fE ">GOTO "start"</span>

GOTO tells the Robot to jump to a label. In this case, the
Robot returns to the label "start", effectively restarting its
code. This particular Robot will be executing these lines of
code for the entirety of the game, or until destroyed.

Pretty easy so far, huh? You will probably find that Robotic's
basics are easy to grasp. Let's try something a little more
complex.

<p class="helpcentered">Your Third Robotic Program</p>
Try the following Robot program:

 <span class="fE ">: "loop"</span>
 <span class="fE ">/ "NNEESSWW"</span>
 <span class="fE ">GOTO "loop"</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "touch"</span>
 <span class="fE ">* "Hello!"</span>
 <span class="fE ">CHAR 'X'</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>

Testing will show you that this Robot runs around in a small
square. Now try touching it. If you can catch it, the Robot
will change to an X and greet you! Let's look at this program.

<span class="fE ">: "loop"</span>

A label.

<span class="fE ">/ "NNEESSWW"</span>

The / command tells the Robot to move along a given path. The
path is represented with a string of the letters N, S, E, W,
and I. NSEW represent the four cardinal directions, while I
tells the Robot to wait for a bit before continuing. Our path
tells the Robot to go north twice, east twice, south twice, and
west twice, forming a square path.

<span class="fE ">GOTO "loop"</span>

The Robot will now return to the "loop" label, continuing in a
square path forever. Without an outside stimulus, the Robot
will never do anything else.

<span class="fE ">: "touch"</span>

Another label, but this one is special. When the player touches
a Robot, by standing next to it and pressing against it, the
Robot is sent the message "touch". The following commands will
be run when the player touches the Robot.

<span class="fE ">CHAR 'X'</span>

This tells the Robot to assume the appearance of character X.
Make sure that the X is in apostrophes ' and NOT quotes ".

<p class="helpcentered">Robot Interaction</p>
Let's get some Robots to interact with each other. Put two
Robots on a board, right next to each other. Name the left one
Lefty, and give it this program:

 <span class="fE ">: "dance"</span>
 <span class="fE ">/ "WWWEEE"</span>
 <span class="fE ">SEND "Righty" to "dance"</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>

Name the right one Righty, and give it this program:

 <span class="fE ">END</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "dance"</span>
 <span class="fE ">/ "EEEWWW"</span>
 <span class="fE ">SEND "Lefty" to "dance"</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>

Now test this board out. You will see a silly pair of dancing
Robots, as they bump each other left and right. Let's examine
their programs more closely.

Since Righty has an END command as the first line, he isn't
going to be doing anything until told; so, we look at Lefty.
It's nothing we haven't seen, except for the SEND command.

<span class="fE ">SEND "Robot" to "message"</span>

The SEND command allows one Robot to send messages to another,
telling it what to do. In this case, Lefty will tell Righty to
"dance", sending Righty to the label "dance".

Knowing this, the behavior of the two Robots should be clear.
Each one, in turn, moves away and back again, then it tells
the other one to do this. This repeats ad infinitum.

For a little practice, see if you can get them each to display
a message at the start of their dance step. Make the messages
different for each Robot.

<p class="helpcentered">Some New Commands</p>
The following Robot will demonstrate some new commands and
features.

 <span class="fE ">GIVE 6 AMMOS</span>
 <span class="fE ">GIVE 5 HIBOMBS</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "shot"</span>
 <span class="fE ">COLOR c2C</span>
 <span class="fE ">[ "OKAY, I GET THE POINT. I NEED MORE IRON"</span>
 <span class="fE ">[ "...and now a liver transplant :<"</span>
 <span class="fE ">zap "shot" 1</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "shot"</span>
 <span class="fE ">IF "AMMO" = 0 "lecture"</span>
 <span class="fE ">[ "...cut it out. =("</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "bombed"</span>
 <span class="fE ">. "Check this out..."</span>
 <span class="fE ">. "(editor) I'm not impressed."</span>
 <span class="fE ">* "ARRGHFRRAGGH I'M ALLERGIC TO BEING BOMBED"</span>
 <span class="fE ">DIE</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "touch"</span>
 <span class="fE ">* "Please leave me alone :/"</span>
 <span class="fE ">WAIT 10</span>
 <span class="fE ">SHOOT SEEK</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>
 <span class="fE ">: "lecture"</span>
 <span class="fE ">[ "Did you REALLY have to use all of your shots."</span>
 <span class="fE ">END</span>

Test this Robot out, bombing, shooting, and touching it. The
new commands and labels are explained below.

<span class="fE ">GIVE 6 AMMOS</span>

Sensibly enough, this gives the player 6 units of ammo.

<span class="fE ">GIVE 5 HIBOMBS</span>

This gives the player 5 high-strength bombs.

<span class="fE ">: "shot"</span>

When the Robot is shot by a bullet, it is sent this message.

<span class="fE ">COLOR c2C</span>

This changes the Robot's color. The c2C represents Lt. Red on
Red. To enter colors, press F2 in the Robot editor and select
the color you want. The appropriate cXX code will be typed in
for you.

<span class="fE ">[ "OKAY, I GET THE POINT. I NEED MORE IRON"</span>
<span class="fE ">[ "...and now a liver transplant :<"</span>

The [ command is slick for a default. When encountered, all
consecutive [ commands are put together to form one long
message, which is then displayed in a Scroll-like window.
It can be scrolled and viewed by the player.

<span class="fE ">ZAP "shot" 1</span>

The ZAP command tells the Robot to ignore a certain number of
labels with the given name - in this case, the first "shot"
label. The ZAP command always starts from the top. Using the
ZAP command lets programmers give out different reactions for
going to the same label. In this case, we get to go to the
second "shot" label after we went to the first.

<span class="fE ">IF "AMMO" = 0 "lecture"</span>

The IF command will jump to a label (in this case, one called
"lecture") if the given condition is met, and will continue to
the next line if not met. In this case, it will check to see if
the AMMO counter is 0. The AMMO counter is a built-in counter
MZX uses to represent how many units of ammo the player holds.

<span class="fE ">: "bombed"</span>

When the Robot is bombed, or otherwise hit by an explosion,
it is sent this message.

<span class="fE ">. "Check this out..."</span>
<span class="fE ">. "(editor) I'm not impressed."</span>

Notice how this message was not shown in any way. The . command
is used for comments, i.e. messages that are not to be shown.
They are good for your own reference, so you know what you were
trying to do with this Robot, or so you can keep notes of
important things.

<span class="fE ">DIE</span>

This command destroys the Robot forever.

<span class="fE ">WAIT 10</span>

WAIT causes the Robot to stop and sit for an amount of time.
The time is in number of cycles (in this case, 10 cycles). A
cycle is the amount of time it takes to update the board once,
moving all the enemies and bullets, etc. Robots can run at
different speeds; the default is cycle 1 (fastest, runs every
real cycle) unless a cycle command is placed inside the Robot.

<span class="fE ">SHOOT SEEK</span>

The Robot will shoot a bullet in the indicated direction (in
this case, the direction the player is in).

<p class="helpcentered">Conclusion</p>
You now should know enough Robotic for simple programs. Even
more importantly, you should be able to scan the Robotic
reference manual, including the command reference, and be able
to learn many new commands. There are loads of important
commands and concepts in the command reference that we have not
yet mentioned, such as TELEPORT PLAYER, strings, file access,
expressions, sprites, and the COPY class of statements. It is
recommended that you at least skim each of the Robotic reference
manual sections.

Make sure you (eventually) read over every part of the
reference manual, as there are many sections not covered in the
tutorials. Especially of interest will be advanced topics like
"The Vlayer and Its Uses", "Using MZMs", "Subroutines",
"Debug Modes", and most newer help file additions.

<a class="helpanchor" name="THEGLOBL.HLP__gbl"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Global</span></p>
The global Robot is a special-case Robot; it is always present
on every board of the game. It is immobile (technically off the
board, but listed as at (-1,-1)), has a ROBOT_ID of 0, and
cannot be destroyed or changed into another object, even
through deliberate attempts to do so such as the EXPLODE
command. All other traits of Robots, such as 2MB of Robot
memory, reserved local counters and the ability to be copied,
apply to the global.

The global is accessed either through pressing G to access the
Global Settings menu and then clicking Edit Global Robot, or by
simply pressing Alt+G on the editor screen.

The global is important because it not only exists on all
boards, but also continues its state across boards. This allows
for easy management of continuous global engines such as an
inventory, status bars, and sidescrolling control, among
other possibilities. If the global did not exist, a copy of the
engine would be needed on every board, and the states of each
such Robot would be separate (possibly leading to management
problems).

Certain commands (as hinted above) are worthless in the global.
Obvious commands such as BECOME, EXPLODE, COLOR/CHAR and all
command forms that take a relative direction (like LAYBOMB and
DUPLICATE SELF [dir]) will be ignored. DIE, DIE ITEM and GOTOXY
# # are completely ignored as well. Any checks at (-1,-1) will
fail to detect the global.

Finally, the global is the only Robot that ignores FREEZETIME
and SLOWTIME states. This is extremely handy in creating the
ability to pause and unpause a MegaZeux game, among other
things.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Robotic Usages That Should be Avoided</span></p>
There are several coding pitfalls in Robotic; while some are
complex in nature, others can be easily avoided. In general,
clean and efficient code is the least likely to cause
unexpected errors as well as the easiest to repair. Listed here
are several practices to avoid, as well as proper replacements.

<span class="fc ">BAD: Creating anything with c?? or p??</span>
  Anything that has an undefined value will use a default
  that may be undesirable. The correct action would therefore
  be to define the object's color and parameter values. c?? and
  p?? generally exist for the sake of Robotic comparisons and
  conditional branching, not for being applied to actual
  objects.
  Sprites are an exception regarding color, since they refer to
  a set of placed characters with their own colors.
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Putting in set values for colors and parameters when</span>
  <span class="f9 ">placing objects.</span>

<span class="fc ">BAD: Using global counters for temporary or localized work.</span>
  There are several counters that are Robot-specific and don't
  eat up global counter space. local through local32 per Robot
  should be enough for almost everyone, and the local counters
  can be written to and read by other robots as well (using the
  rN.local# counter form). If global temp counters are used in
  a Robot with several copies on the board, you will most likely
  run into problems. Unfortunately, using local counters can
  come at the cost of minor readability, since local counters
  cannot be given descriptive names.
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Using local counters for temporary or localized work.</span>

<span class="fC ">BAD: Breaking a subroutine without returning or entering the</span>
  <span class="fC ">middle of a subroutine.</span>
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Fully finishing and starting subroutines.</span>
  This is especially important for built-in labels which can
  trigger very rapidly, such as #keyN.

<span class="fc ">BAD: Using a high amount of if statements regarding one</span>
  <span class="fC ">variable.</span>
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Using "label&number&" as the destination label in IF</span>
  <span class="f9 ">statements regarding one variable.</span>

<span class="fC ">BAD: Looping without using cycle-ending commands of any kind.</span>
  Looping without CYCLE 1 or WAIT 1 in idle loops is more
  severe than one might think. Coupled with the "commands"
  counter set to a high number, loops without CYCLE 1 or WAIT 1
  can absolutely choke a game's speed, especially idle loops,
  and potentially FREEZE YOUR GAME.
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Including CYCLE 1 or WAIT 1 in every loop except loops</span>
  <span class="f9 ">that are designed to get a finite length task done as</span>
  <span class="f9 ">quickly as possible.</span>
  You should add a CYCLE 1 or WAIT 1 for any loop that
  constantly checks for events (such as keypresses or board
  status).
  
<span class="fC ">BAD: Setting the COMMANDS value to maximum.</span>
  It's generally unneeded, and a loop without a cycle-ending
  command coupled with this change is a guaranteed way to cause
  freezes in MZX. MZX has safeguards for when this happens, but
  it is still very undesirable.
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Setting the COMMANDS counter to a reasonably high value.</span>
  Your code can utilize the extra processing speed higher
  commands-per-cycle allows, and if a loop without a
  cycle-ending command is accidentally created, it becomes
  apparent without requiring severe intervention.

<span class="fc ">BAD: Ending Robots with a label.</span>
<span class="f9 ">GOOD: Ending Robots with the END command.</span>
  It's debatable whether putting END after commands that
  destroy the Robot (e.g. DIE, EXPLODE #) is necessary, but it
  is still recommended in order to prevent a habit of leaving
  it out in less redundant places.

<div class="helpfile" id="SUBROUTE.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="SUBROUTE.HLP__sub"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Subroutines</span></p>
Subroutines are returnable labels, in essence. After the
subroutine actions finish, the Robotic goes to the line right
after the subroutine call. Anywhere a label can be used, a
subroutine can be called.

Another way to think about it is a label with a place marker.
Going to this label marks your previous place; when done, the
program goes straight to the place marker and returns where it
left off.

Subroutines are accessed by using the # sign as the first
letter. For example: <span class="fe ">goto "#example"</span><span class="ff "> would call the</span>
subroutine at the label "#example". To return to the next
command after the call use <span class="fe ">goto "#return"</span><span class="ff ">.</span>

In addition, one can go to the first subroutine's return
position using <span class="fe ">goto "#top"</span><span class="ff ">.</span>

A quick example of subroutines:

<span class="fE ">* "YE SHALL NOT PASS UNLESS YOU GIVE ME SPACE."</span>
<span class="fE ">goto "#spacewait"</span>
<span class="fE ">* "THAT'S BETTER BUT YOU'RE STILL HERE. _CORRECT THIS_"</span>
<span class="fE ">goto "#spacewait"</span>
<span class="fE ">* "THANKS FOR YOUR COMPLIANCE!"</span>
<span class="fE ">wait 25</span>
<span class="fE ">* "YOUR PASS WILL ARRIVE IN 6 TO 8 WEEKS! or now! byebyebye"</span>
<span class="fE ">set "PASS" to 1</span>
<span class="fE ">die</span>
<span class="fE ">end</span>
<span class="fE ">: "#spacewait"</span>
<span class="fE ">: "spaceheld"</span>
<span class="fE ">cycle 1</span>
<span class="fE ">. "If space is held down, progress no further."</span>
<span class="fE ">. "We want to force space to be pressed each time."</span>
<span class="fE ">if spacepressed "spaceheld"</span>
<span class="fE ">: "notspaceloop"</span>
<span class="fE ">cycle 1</span>
<span class="fE ">if not spacepressed "notspaceloop"</span>
<span class="fE ">goto "#return"</span>

When sending other robots to subroutines the behavior is
slightly different. Because the robot is pre-empted
(interrupted) it will return to the same command it was at
before going to the subroutine, not the instruction after.

When using subroutines, especially with easily triggerable
conditions, it is important to try to make sure that every
subroutine send ends in a #return, or that every set of
subroutine sends ends in a #top. The built-in labels can be
especially problematic, as some can trigger rapidly in a short
period of time. State management with LOCKSELF and/or ZAP is
crucial.

NOTE: Unlike older versions of MegaZeux, it is no longer needed
to initialize the stack, so don't get confused looking at older
examples of code and seeing odd statements like <span class="fe ">. "#*-1-2-3"</span><span class="ff ">.</span>
These statements are now treated as comments, and you should
mentally treat them the same way.

<a class="helplink" href="#ROBOTICR.HLP__087">Robotic Reference Manual</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<hr /></div>

<div class="helpfile" id="EXPRESS.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="EXPRESS.HLP__exp"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Expressions</span></p>
Expressions in MegaZeux allow users to set counters or a
displayed number to a mathematical expression. The possible
inputs are: counters, constants, or a combination. Any
expression in MegaZeux is bound in quotation marks and
parentheses. For example, an expression adding 5 and 3 would
be done in MegaZeux by inputting "(5 + 3)".

Counters can be used inside expressions using single quotes or
ampersands like so: "(&five& + 'three')".

Unlike in many other programming languages, MegaZeux does not
follow a strict order of operations. Items in parentheses take
precedence, with other operator precedence solely determined by
their position (from left to right).

For example, "(5 - 4 * 20 / (21 - 16))" would evaulate to 4.
5 - 4 evaluates to 1; 1 * 20 evaluates to 20; 20 / (21 - 16)
first evaluates to 20 / 5, which becomes 4.

Whitespace between operators is not necessary. (5+3) is as valid
as (5 + 3).

MegaZeux cannot decipher directly nested ampersands or single
quotes; such will cause MegaZeux to misinterpret your
expression in different ways, depending on which you used.
Therefore, using expressions for nesting is another benefit.

Example: We set "r" to 1, "in" to 8 and "out18" to 11. We want
to output the value of "out18".
"(&out&r&&in&&)" would output (0r&in&).
"('out'r''in'')" would output ('out'r''in'')
"('out('r')('in')')" would output the desired result - 11.

Nesting is limited only to the amount one can put in a single
editor line - 241 characters.

In expressions, the following operators may be used:

Binary operators (value-argument-value):

 +   Addition
 -   Subtraction
 *   Multiplication
 /   Division
 %   Modulo
 ^   Exponent (A^B is A to the Bth order/power)
 >>  Bitshift Right (logical, not arithmetic)
 <<  Bitshift Left (logical, not arithmetic)
 >>> Signed Shift Right (arithmetic)
 >   Greater Than
 <   Less Than
 >=  Greater Than or Equal To
 <=  Less Than or Equal To
 =   Equal To
 !=  Not Equal To
 a   Bitwise AND (not logical AND)
 o   Bitwise OR (not logical OR)
 x   Bitwise XOR (not logical XOR)

<span class="fE ">+ Addition</span><span class="fF ">: Outputs the sum of the two given values. (3+2)</span>
would return 5.
<span class="fE ">- Subtraction</span><span class="fF ">: Outputs the difference of the two given values.</span>
(3-2) would return 1.
<span class="fE ">* Multiplication</span><span class="fF ">: Outputs the product of the two given values.</span>
(3*2) would return 6.
<span class="fE ">/ Division</span><span class="fF ">: Outputs the quotient of the two given values.</span>
(3/2) would return 1. Note that any fractional values will be
truncated, i.e. have the decimal part of the number thrown out.
<span class="fE ">% Modulo</span><span class="fF ">: Outputs the remainder of the two given values, when</span>
both values are positive. (5%3) would return 2. The modulo
expression function and the modulo command may output different
results if any number involved is negative; unlike the command,
the modulo expression function uses a floored modulo.
To explain, if the dividend is negative, than the result will
be the divisor minus the remainder (e.g. (-5%3) would return
1); if the divisor is negative, than the result will be the
additive inverse of the difference of the divisor and the
remainder (e.g. (5%-3) would return -1); if BOTH are negative,
the result will be the additive inverse of the remainder (e.g.
(-5%-3) would return -2).
<span class="fE ">^ Exponent</span><span class="fF ">: Outputs the result of taking the first number to</span>
the power of the second number. (3^2) would return 9.
<span class="fE ">>> Bitshift Right</span><span class="fF ">: Shifts the first number rightward by [second</span>
number] of bits. Info shifted off of the boundaries will NOT
wrap around. Using an 8-bit counter for clarity's sake, (5>>2)
would turn 5 [00000101] into 1 [00000001] by shifting two bits
rightward.
<span class="fE "><< Bitshift Left</span><span class="fF ">: Shifts the first number leftward by [second</span>
number] of bits. Info shifted off of the boundaries will NOT
wrap around. Using an 8-bit counter for clarity's sake, (5<<2)
would turn 5 [00000101] into 20 [00010100] by shifting two bits
leftward.
<span class="fE ">>>> Signed Shift Right</span><span class="fF ">: Also known as Arithmetic Right Shift.</span>
Shifts the first number rightward by [second number] of bits,
but unlike normal bitshift right, shifts in whatever number was
in the leftmost bit instead of always shifting in 0s. Info
shifted off of the boundaries still will not wrap around. Using
an 8-bit counter for clarity's sake, (5>>>2) would turn 5
[00000101] into 1 [00000001], while (-5>>>2) would turn -5
[11111011] into -2 [11111110].
<span class="fE ">> Greater Than</span><span class="fF ">: If the first number is greater than the second</span>
number, outputs 1 (TRUE); otherwise, outputs 0 (FALSE). (3>2)
would return 1, (2>2) would return 0.
<span class="fE ">< Less Than</span><span class="fF ">: If the first number is less than the second</span>
number, outputs 1 (TRUE); otherwise, outputs 0 (FALSE). (3<2)
would return 0, as would (2<2).
<span class="fE ">>= Greater Than or Equal To</span><span class="fF ">: If the first number is either</span>
greater than or equal to the second number, outputs 1 (TRUE);
otherwise, outputs 0 (FALSE). (3>=2) would return 1, as would
(2>=2).
<span class="fE "><= Less Than or Equal To</span><span class="fF ">: If the first number is either less</span>
than or equal to the second number, outputs 1 (TRUE);
otherwise, outputs 0 (FALSE). (3<=2) would return 0, (2<=2)
would return 1.
<span class="fE ">= Equal To</span><span class="fF ">: If the first number is the same value as the second</span>
number, outputs 1 (TRUE); otherwise, outputs 0 (FALSE). (3=2)
would return 0, (2=2) would return 1.
<span class="fE ">!= Not Equal To</span><span class="fF ">: If the first number is a different value</span>
compared to the second number, outputs 1 (TRUE); otherwise,
outputs 0 (FALSE). (3!=2) would return 1, (2!=2) would return
0.
<span class="fE ">a = Bitwise AND</span><span class="fF ">: Performs a bitwise AND operation on the two</span>
given values; i.e. compares the bits of each value and sets to
1 each bit that is 1 in both numbers. Using an 8-bit counter
for clarity's sake, (5a3) would return 1, as 5 [00000101] and 3
[00000011] has only the bit in the ones place set in both
numbers, leaving 1 [00000001].
<span class="fE ">o = Bitwise OR</span><span class="fF ">: Performs a bitwise OR operation on the two</span>
given values; i.e. compares the bits of each value and sets to
1 each bit that is 1 in either number. Using an 8-bit counter
for clarity's sake, (5o3) would return 7, as 5 [00000101] and
3 [00000011] have bits set in the fours, twos, and ones places
among them, leaving 7 [00000111].
<span class="fE ">x = Bitwise XOR</span><span class="fF ">: Performs a bitwise XOR operation on the two</span>
given values; i.e. compares the bits of each value and sets to
1 each bit that is different between numbers. Using an 8-bit
counter for clarity's sake, (5x3) would return 6, as 5
[00000101] and 3 [00000011] have different bits set in the
fours and the twos places, leaving 6 [00000110].

Unary operators (operator followed by value):

<span class="fE ">- Unary Negation</span><span class="fF ">: returns the negative value of the operand</span>
(two's complement); i.e. reverses the sign of a number. (-10)
would return -10.
<span class="fE ">~ Bitwise Negation</span><span class="fF ">: returns the bitwise NOT value of the</span>
operand (one's complement); i.e. changes each bit in a number.
Using an 8-bit counter for clarity's sake, (~10) [00001010]
would return -11. [11110101]

Ternary operators (value - operator token - value - operator
token - value):

<span class="fE ">?: Conditional Operator</span><span class="fF ">: Evaluates expressions based on the</span>
value of the first given expression. This operator is often
simply called the ternary operator. If the expression to the
left of the question mark is non-zero, the expression between
the question mark and colon is evaluated; otherwise, the
expression to the right of the colon is evaluated. For example,
If "local" is 35, SET "local" ('local'<60?'local'+2:'local'+1)
would set the value of "local" to 37, as the first expression
evaluates to 1 and the second expression ('local'+2) is then
evaluated.

Special usages:

-Using a constant expression "(n)" is the only way to directly
use numbers over 32767 or under -32768. This can not be changed
due to the way the world file format is coded. This is also the
only way to use octal (base 8) and full-sized hexadecimal
numbers; octal numbers always begin with a 0 (ex: 01745) and hex
numbers begin with 0x (ex: 0xDEAF).

<a class="helpanchor" name="FILEACSS.HLP__fil"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">File Access</span></p>
MegaZeux allows somewhat unwieldy but powerful file access
abilities. File access can do things that no other tools of
MegaZeux can do, such as create high score tables or preserve
and unlock game options without needing a save. An MZX world
can access any file in its own directory or deeper, including
for charset, palette, sound and MZM loading commands. To do
this, give MZX the subdirectory name as well as the file name.
Both slashes and backslashes are accepted, regardless of OS.
Examples: "subdir/subsubdir/file.txt", "subdir\\file.txt".
Access of folders outside of this range is forbidden.

MegaZeux has some ways of accessing standard formats in-game:

<span class="fA ">SET "file.txt" to "SAVE_ROBOT"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.txt" to "LOAD_ROBOT"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.txt" to "SAVE_ROBOTn"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.txt" to "LOAD_ROBOTn"</span>

These commands can save Robotic code to text files and import
text files into a Robot. The first forms use the current Robot,
while the second forms use the Robot with the given Robot ID n.
String inputs are also accepted in place of hard-coded file
names.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.bc" to "SAVE_BC"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.bc" to "LOAD_BC"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.bc" to "SAVE_BCn"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.bc" to "LOAD_BCn"</span>

These commands can save Robotic code to files in bitcode format
and import bitcode files into a Robot. The first forms use the
current Robot, while the second forms use the Robot with the
given Robot ID n. Bitcode is much more compact than plain text,
but cannot be easily read by the human eye.

Note that for loading Robotic code via LOAD_ROBOT(n) or
LOAD_BC(n), any and all local counters previously set in the
Robot will retain their value.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.sav" to "SAVE_GAME"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.sav" to "LOAD_GAME"</span>

These commands save or load MZX savegames, respectively.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.sav" to "SAVE_COUNTERS"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "file.sav" to "LOAD_COUNTERS"</span>

These commands respectively save or load a counters file.
Counter files only contain counter and string data (to be
specific, only global and current board counters/strings).
Unlike save files, they do not require version checks. Saving
will dump the current contents of the current world's counters
and strings; loading will set the current world's counter and
string values to the values given in the file.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.palidx" to "SMZX_INDICES"</span>

This command loads an SMZX indices file. SMZX indices are
essentially miniature palettes and will only load in SMZX Mode
3.

MegaZeux can manipulate any type of file with certain Robotic
commands. Here are some basic things to remember when using file
access.

-A file can only be read or written to at one time, never both.
This means you can't select the same file to be the current
"FREAD_OPEN" and "FWRITE_OPEN" targets.
-Only one file can be read to and one can be written to at the
same time.
-Writing and reading operations change the current fwrite and
fread positions.
-The writing and reading position is set to 0 (the beginning
position of a file) when a file is loaded, unless the 
FWRITE_APPEND command is chosen.
-There is a special character called the terminator (char #42,
'*', by default) placed at the end of a write when a string is
written to a file with FWRITE. This character ends an FREAD to
a string when encountered (the terminator character itself will
not be in the string output). However, using FWRITEn will not
place a terminator, and FREADn will ignore any terminator
characters encountered.
-To find the length of a file, use the FREAD_LENGTH and
FWRITE_LENGTH counters. They will report the length of the file
currently open in the respective mode in characters. If a
directory is open for reading, the counter will be the number of
files and subdirectories in that directory. If there is no file
or directory open, these counters will return -1.
-Lastly, files need to be closed when the current task is
finished. Otherwise, the file remains open and causes problems.
To close a file, use SET "" to "FREAD_OPEN" to close a file for
reading and SET "" to "FWRITE_OPEN" to close a file for
writing.

Here are the file writing commands at your disposal.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.xxx" to "FREAD_OPEN"</span>

This command loads a file for reading.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.xxx" to "FWRITE_OPEN"</span>

This command creates a new file for writing; if a file by this
name already exists, it is overwritten.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.xxx" to "FWRITE_MODIFY"</span>

This command opens an existing file for reading without
overwriting it, starting at the beginning of the file.

<span class="fA ">SET "file.xxx" to "FWRITE_APPEND"</span>

This command opens a file for writing at the END of the file.
Please note that FWRITE_POS settings will not work in this
mode.

<span class="fA ">SET "FREAD_POS" to #</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "FWRITE_POS" to #</span>

These commands change the current reading or writing position
of the accessed files. The position is in DECIMAL, not
hexadecimal, and the first position is 0; when no file is
loaded, the relevant counter is -1.

Setting "FREAD_POS" or "FWRITE_POS" to -1 is called "file
end seeking" and will set the relevant counter to the final
position in the file (or -1 if the file does not exist). This is
very helpful for placing stuff at the end of a file.

<span class="fA ">SET "dir" to "FREAD_OPEN"</span>

This command opens subdirectories for reading (by using the name
of the subdirectory by itself, e.g. <span class="fA ">SET "directory" to</span>
"FREAD_OPEN"<span class="fF ">). FREAD will then list the names of files in the</span>
directory, with each read position being a different filename.
Note that the files are not guaranteed to be read in any
specific order.

<span class="fA ">SET "FREAD_DELIMITER" to #</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "FWRITE_DELIMITER" to #</span>

These commands change the character considered the terminator.
The FREAD command changes which character is detected as the
terminator, and the FWRITE command changes which character is
written as the terminator.

<span class="fA ">SET "counter" to "FREAD_COUNTER"</span>

Reads from the open file to a counter. This will grab four
bytes instead of the normal one (treated as signed; the
resulting range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647).

<span class="fA ">SET "FWRITE_COUNTER" to "counter"</span>

Writes from a counter to the open file. This will write the
full counter instead of simply the first byte (treated as
signed; the resulting range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647).

<span class="fA ">SET "FWRITE" to "counter"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "$string" to "FWRITE"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "$string" to "FWRITEn"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "counter" to "FREAD"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "$string" to "FREAD"</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "$string" to "FREADn"</span>

These commands write values to and read values from,
respectively, the open file relative to the FWRITE_POS or
FREAD_POS counters. FWRITE and FREAD, when used with counters,
only write one byte at a time (from 0-255).
The SET "$string" to "FWRITEn" and "FREADn" commands will write
the first n characters (relative to FREAD_POS or FWRITE_POS)
from the file to the given string or read the first n
characters from the string into the open file, respectively.
Using <span class="fA ">SET "$string.N" to "FWRITE(n)"</span><span class="fF "> will ensure that the</span>
string will be at least N characters long when written.
FWRITE and FREAD, when used with counters, can be substituted
by FWRITE_COUNTER and FREAD_COUNTER to read in longer values
at a time (four bytes as opposed to one).

Here's a quick example of file access.

<span class="fE ">SET "example.txt" to "FWRITE_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$zoosound" to "ROAAAAR"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$zoosound" to "FWRITE"</span>
<span class="fE ">DEC "FWRITE_POS" by 1</span>
<span class="fE ">. "This line backs us up one space so that the terminator</span>
<span class="fE ">. "character will be overwritten, allowing us to display the"</span>
<span class="fE ">. "whole contents of the file."</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$ender" to " (click)"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$ender" to "FWRITE"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "" to "FWRITE_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">. "We're closing the file because we're going to read from it."</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "example.txt" to "FREAD_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">ASK "Want to play your animal sounds tape?"</span>
<span class="fE ">END</span>
<span class="fE ">: "yes"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$tape" to "FREAD"</span>
<span class="fE ">* "&$tape&"</span>
<span class="fE ">WAIT for 30</span>
<span class="fE ">ZAP "yes" 1</span>
<span class="fE ">ASK "Want to play it again?"</span>
<span class="fE ">END</span>
<span class="fE ">: "yes"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "" to "FREAD_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">. "Switching tasks for the same file again."</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "example.txt" to "FWRITE_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">. "We're wiping the file clean."</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$winder" to "bzz-bz-zipfwip--(clik) "</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$winder" to "FWRITE"</span>
<span class="fE ">DEC "FWRITE_POS" by 1</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$tape" to "FWRITE"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "" to "FWRITE_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "example.txt" to "FREAD_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">ZAP "yes" 1</span>
<span class="fE ">: "yes"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "FREAD_POS" to 0</span>
<span class="fE ">. "We're forcing the beginning position because we want to"</span>
<span class="fE ">. "read all of the file every possible time, not just the"</span>
<span class="fE ">. "first time."</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "$tape" to "FREAD"</span>
<span class="fE ">* "&$tape&"</span>
<span class="fE ">WAIT for 30</span>
<span class="fE ">ASK "Want to play it again?"</span>
<span class="fE ">END</span>
<span class="fE ">: "no"</span>
<span class="fE ">SET "" to "FREAD_OPEN"</span>
<span class="fE ">END</span>

This Robot will display first a roar and the sound of a tape
player clicking off before it asks if you want to play the tape
again. If no, the file is closed and the program ended. If yes,
rewinding tape sounds are stuck on the front of the text. The
player can then choose to re-view this text until "No" is
chosen.

<div class="helpfile" id="SPRITES.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="SPRITES.HLP__spr"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Sprites</span></p>
Sprites allow the designer to have interactive entities on the
board composed of several characters. A sprite is a block of
characters drawn on the board or the vlayer that is then
displayed on the board, either beneath or above the overlay.
The biggest benefit of sprites is that they are cohesive:
unlike use of several Robots, there is absolutely no chance of
the sprite falling apart.

Sprites also have the benefit of a well-defined draw order. This
means that if sprites overlap, it is easy to determine which
sprite gets shown in the overlap. By default, sprites determine
this by sprite number. The sprites are drawn in order of sprite
number, which means that parts of higher-numbered sprites will
be displayed over lower-numbered ones whenever they overlap.

There are up to 256 available sprites (globally, not per board),
and sprites are controlled in the following ways:

-Through sprite-specific counters named SPRn_value ("n" being
 the sprite number, e.g. SPR10_value modifies sprite number 10)
-Through control counters for all of the sprites
-Through commands for placing sprites and testing for collision

To set up a sprite you must set the SPRn_REFX / REFY / WIDTH /
HEIGHT counters to define where the sprite's characters are and
the sprite's size. (SPRn_REFX and SPRn_REFY are the x,y
coordinates for the upper-left corner of the reference
characters, which are the characters a sprite uses for its
appearance.) Then you use:

<span class="fA ">PUT cXX sprite pNN x y</span>

where NN is the number of the sprite in hexadecimal (if you
write NN without the p in decimal it will be automatically
converted). If cXX is c?? then the sprite is drawn with the
colors of the reference characters, otherwise it's painted with
the given colors.

So, for example, to make a 2x2 sprite, you could base its
reference characters on the board from the position (10, 10),
assign it to sprite number 15, then have it drawn at position
(40, 5). The Robotic for this is as follows:

<span class="fA ">SET "spr15_refx" 10</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "spr15_refy" 10</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "spr15_width" 2</span>
<span class="fA ">SET "spr15_height" 2</span>
<span class="fA ">PUT c?? sprite p0f 40 5</span>

You can then move the sprite around by changing spr15_x and
spr15_y. For example, using:

<span class="fA ">INC "spr15_x" 1</span>
<span class="fA ">DEC "spr15_y" 1</span>

will move the sprite to the northeast by 1.

As with the overlay, any instance of char 32 in the sprite will
not be shown, instead displaying the next underlying layer.
Also, if the reference characters change, the sprite's
characters will change to match, as will colors of a c?? sprite.

Outside of simple sprite motion such as this, you can do
collision tests. These check if moving sprites will cause
collision (i.e. overlapping) with either the foreground (i.e.
customblocks) or with other sprites. This way, you can do things
such as prevent sprites from moving on top of walls or on top of
other characters, or allow a sprite to damage another one when
striking.

For these, sprite collision boxes must be set, as sprites will
not have one set by default. Use the SPRn_CX and SPRn_CY
counters to set the respective x,y coordinates of the upper-left
corner of the collision box, and use SPRn_CWIDTH and
SPRn_CHEIGHT to set its respective width and height (in tiles).

Once collision boxes are established, collision tests have to
be triggered. This is done by using the following command:

<span class="fA ">IF c?? sprite_colliding pNN x y "collision"</span>

This will go to the label "collision" if moving sprite NN x by
y from its current position would cause it to collide with
something. If anything besides c?? is used then (x, y) are
absolute board coordinates instead.

If colliding happens, then the spr_clistN counters will be
set to what sprite numbers it collided with - one counter set
for each other sprite in the collision, starting with spr_clist0
- and spr_collisions will be set to the number of things that
the sprite collided with. If the sprite collided with the
foreground, spr_clist0 will be set to -1.

So for instance, if the sprite collided with the foreground and
sprites 2 and 3, spr_collisions will be set to 3, spr_clist0
will be -1, spr_clist1 will be 2, and spr_clist2 will be 3. If
the sprite collided only with sprites 2 and 3, spr_collisions
will be set to 2, spr_clist0 will be 2, and spr_clist1 will be
3. The values of spr_clistN with values of N greater than
(spr_collisions - 1) are undefined.

Alternatively, a collision check for a sprite can be done by
setting that sprite n's "SPRn_CLIST" counter to anything. This
checks that sprite against its current location and does not
force a label jump on collision.

Sprites can be set to ignore certain types of blocks in
collision checks by setting the sprN_ccheck value of a given
sprite N. In addition, setting a sprite's ccheck value to 2 will
prevent blank characters in a sprite from being shown, much like
char 32.

Since sprites are global, they will persist upon changing
boards. Since the vlayer is global as well, using the vlayer to
reference characters (by setting the SPRn_VLAYER counter to 1)
will keep sprite characters consistent between boards.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Unbound Sprites</span></p><a class="helpanchor" name="SPRITES.HLP__ubs"> </a>
Unbound sprites are sprites with special implementations,
allowing significantly greater precision and access to extra
character sets. They have their own setup, their own quirks, and
their own unique restrictions.

A sprite can be set as unbound by setting the SPRn_UNBOUND
counter to 1 for a given sprite number n. Once this is done, the
sprite becomes "unbound" from the tile grid and immediately
starts using pixels as reference for the collision box (SPRn_CX,
SPRn_CY, SPRn_CWIDTH, SPRn_CHEIGHT) and sprite location (SPRn_X,
SPRn_Y). Other attributes, such as reference location and sprite
dimensions, are left in terms of tiles. Essentially, this means
that sprite control and collision checks can now be easily
pixel-based.

(If, for whatever reason, a sprite is given tile-based x/y
parameters and placed before setting as an unbound sprite, the
sprite will not adjust its x/y location in pixels to match and
will keep the literal x/y values, adjusting them to be in terms
of pixels instead of tiles once the unbound status is set.)

On top of pixel-based manipulation, unbound sprites have
extended display options at their disposal. Unlike other
sprites, unbound sprites are allowed access to up to 14 "extra"
character sets.

First, one must place characters in the extra locations.
This can be done in two ways: with the LOAD CHAR SET command or
the CHAR EDIT command. With LOAD CHAR SET, extra character sets
can be loaded into their proper places by using the @ prefix to
load it into proper positions. The first extra character set
begins at position 256, the second at 512, the third at 768, and
so on. (One could also load a character set file that is much
larger than normal to fill these positions.) CHAR EDIT can
manipulate individual characters of an extra charset by being
given similar numbers, but the command cannot take them
directly; one must feed it a counter with the desired number
instead.

Second, the sprite must be set to access these charsets. This is
done by setting an offset for that sprite using the SPRn_OFFSET
counter. For example, setting SPR0_OFFSET to 256 will change all
character references done by sprite 0 to the first extra
character set.

As this process implies, each unbound sprite is still limited to
one character set's worth of characters - 256 - simultaneously.
However, different unbound sprites can accept different offsets
and display their sets of characters at the same time, resulting
in up to 3840 different characters loaded at once (not counting
the system set).

In addition to access to larger numbers of characters, unbound
sprites can provide transparency effects on a per-sprite basis,
instead of merely treating certain characters as transparent.
Each unbound sprite has its own transparent color, which is set
with the SPRn_TCOL counter. All pixels of that color in that
unbound sprite will not display, and instead show the next
underlying layer.

When assigned a ccheck value with SPRn_CCHECK, an unbound sprite
will only apply its personal ccheck value in collision tests
instead of the value of the sprite that initiated the check. In
addition, unbound sprites can use a special ccheck value (3) to
ignore transparent colors in collision checks.

Finally, SMZX modes do not affect unbound sprite movement and
manipulation. This fact can be exploited to overlap SMZX sprites
and potentially raise detail to normal MZX mode levels while
retaining much of SMZX's palette benefits.

Unfortunately, unbound sprites cannot be used with all MZX
renderers. At present, the overlay2 renderer (which is a 
low-overhead renderer intended for platforms with weak video
hardware that cannot support SDL2) is incompatible with
unbound sprites.

See the Sprite Counters and Robotic sections for other features
of sprites not noted here.

<div class="helpfile" id="SMZXMODE.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="SMZXMODE.HLP__095"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Super MegaZeux Modes</span></p>
Super MZX modes (a.k.a. SMZX) allow richer color options at the
expense of halved horizontal resolution per character. The
number of colors per character doubles to four, while the number
of total max colors on-screen at one time squares to 256.
However, each mode works differently and has different
limitations and uses.

In the editor, F11 switches display modes. To set Super MZX
modes in a game, use the <span class="fA ">set "smzx_mode" # </span><span class="fF ">Robotic command,</span>
where # is the SMZX mode (0 to revert to normal mode).

Super MZX mode 1 is the simplest mode and the easiest mode to
use. SMZX mode 1 simply blends the foreground and background
colors to get the third and fourth character colors. It is
obviously limited, as this mode only allows editing of the 16
base colors, but is useful for anti-aliasing and shading
effects.

Super MZX mode 2 is the most difficult mode to use, although it
has its benefits. It allows considerable control over the
palette and allows for some overlay and sprite translucency
effects. All 256 colors can be individually manipulated, and
each color also represents a subpalette of four colors that is
used by a character when an object is assigned that color.
The four colors (values in hex) are determined as such:

-Color I is the background color number as the first and second
digits. (For example, if background color is 5, the hex number
of color I is 55.)
-Color II is the foreground color number as the first digit
and the background color number as the second. (For example, if
foreground color is 10 and background color is 5, the hex
number of color II is A5.)
-Color III is the background color number as the first digit and
the foreground color number as the second. (For example, if
background color is 5 and foreground color is 10, the hex
number of color III is 5A.)
-Color IV is the foreground color number as the first and
second digit. (For example, if foreground color is 10, the hex
number of color IV is AA.)

Super MZX mode 3 is the best for dynamic usage of the palette,
and the easiest to edit in general. By default, its four colors
are determined around a base value in hex (background color
number as first digit, foreground color number as second). Color
I's number is the base, II's is base+1, III's is base+2, and
IV's is base+3. The numbers wrap around (so if your base is, for
example, FF, color II would be 00).

However, one can also directly change each value, disregarding
these rules. This essentially allows 256 user-defined
subpalettes of four colors each. These overrides, called SMZX
indices, are loaded and saved out separately from the normal
palette. These changes can only apply for renderers that can
show unbound sprites (which is the vast majority of renderers).

Character editing in Super MZX modes is noticeably different.
While the character set can be edited in MegaZeux's internal
character editor, certain changes occur. 1-4 selects the
desired color; space no longer toggles between colors (it
always sets here); right click no longer clears; clear mode is
gone.

Palette editing for SMZX modes is also accommodated by MZX's
palette editor. However, the user needs to be in the relevant
SMZX mode before loading the palette editor.

On top of direct editing through the editor, SMZX palettes can
be changed on the fly with Robotic. The counters for SMZX
palettes are:

<span class="fB ">SMZX_Rn</span>
<span class="fB ">SMZX_Bn</span>
<span class="fB ">SMZX_Gn</span>

Manipulation of these counters can change or read the value of
color n's red/blue/green value, respectively. n ranges from 0
to 255, and counter values range from 0 to 63.

The SMZX indices can also be directly read or changed with the
<span class="fB ">SMZX_IDXx,y</span><span class="fF "> counter. x is the palette color ranging from 0</span>
to 255; y is one of the given color's indices ranging from 0 to
3.

Lastly, SMZX palettes and character sets can be loaded and
saved like any other palette or character set. SMZX indices must
be loaded in a special manner in Robotic:
<span class="fE ">SET "filename" "SMZX_INDICES"</span><span class="fF ">.</span>
There is a deprecated way to load an SMZX palette in Robotic
(SET "filename" "smzx_palette") due to constraints DOS imposed,
but it is no longer necessary.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__vla"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The Vlayer and Its Uses</span></p>
The vlayer is an extra, global graphical layer, but it is never
directly seen in a game. It can only hold character and color
info. The vlayer acts like a workspace allowing copying from/to
overlay, copying from/to MZMs, copying between places in the
vlayer, reading/writing individual graphical data to/from the
vlayer, and reading strings from the vlayer.

Another important aspect of the vlayer is the ability to
reference a sprite to the vlayer. This allows indirect display
of the vlayer through display of sprites. This can be
exploited to create the semblance of an extra overlay layer.

The vlayer defaults to 32768 characters large (256x128); its
size can be as large as roughly 16.7 million characters (2^24).

While in the editor, press Alt+V to enter the Vlayer Editor. The
vlayer editor accepts the following commands:

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__074"><span class="fE ">Alt+B - Block</span></a>

Press Alt+B to start block mode, then move the cursor to the
opposite corner of a rectangular block and press Alt+B again.
You can then select an action to perform upon the block. In all
copy/move operations, the cursor marks the new UPPER LEFT
corner.

Copy block will allow you to duplicate the block by moving the
cursor to a destination and pressing Enter.
Copy block (repeated) is the same as Copy block but can allow
copying of the same block to multiple places.
Move block will allow you to move the block to a new location.
Clear block will erase the contents of the block.
Flip block will flip the block upside down.
Mirror block will flip the block left to right.
Paint block will change the entire block to the current color.
Copy to board will copy the block to the given spot of the
board. You can choose to place it as either Custom Block, Custom
Floor, or Text.
Copy to overlay will copy the block to the given spot of the
overlay.
Save as MZM will save the block as a layer-type MZM file.

Destinations for Move and Copy can overlap the original block
safely. Ctrl+Dir is especially helpful when doing a repeated
copy block; it moves the cursor the width or height of the
block, ensuring no overlap when pasting.

Like normal Block functions, one can copy between boards by
selecting the board when the editor prompts the user for the
block's destination. Use the B key to select the destination
board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP___C"><span class="fE ">C - Color</span></a>

Press C to select a new current color from a menu. The thing
under the cursor is not affected. One can jump to a color by
typing its hex code in the color menu; for example, typing "0D"
would jump to color 013 (background color 0, foreground color
D).

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP___F"><span class="fE ">F - Fill</span></a>

Press F to fill in an enclosed area with the current character
and color. The area must be completely surrounded by characters
other than the character beneath the cursor. For example, you
can fill over a solid square of As with something else. The
current fill command may not work correctly for very large and
complex areas - in this case, you must move to the unfilled
areas and press F to continue filling. However, this happens
very rarely.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__AltV"><span class="fE ">Alt+V - Exit Vlayer Editor</span></a>

Alt+V will exit vlayer mode and return to editing the main
board.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__103"><span class="fE ">Alt+P - Size</span></a>

Alt+P will open the vlayer size menu. From here, one can change
the dimensions of the vlayer; if the vlayer is shrank in one or
both dimensions, the user will be asked for confirmation. Any
characters removed by shrinking vlayer dimensions are lost, and
any dimension settings that would cause the vlayer to go over
its maximum size will be limited to the largest size possible by
reducing the smallest given dimension until the vlayer is within
size limits (if both given dimensions are the same size, width
is reduced). Changing the size of the vlayer will clear the undo
history of the vlayer.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__F1"><span class="fE ">F1 - Help</span></a>

F1 will bring up context-relevant help. You can press F1 at
almost any time.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__F2"><span class="fE ">F2 - Text</span></a>

F2 will toggle text mode on and off. When text mode is on, Enter
will go to the next line, and Backspace will delete going
backwards. All printable characters will type in as text.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Ar"><span class="fE ">Arrow - Move</span></a>

The arrow keys will move the cursor. The edit window will scroll
when necessary.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__AltAr"><span class="fE ">Alt+Arrow - Move 10</span></a>

Alt with the arrow keys will move the cursor ten spaces at a
time (or to a vlayer edge if it is under 10 spaces away in that
direction).

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__BkSp"><span class="fE ">Backspace - Delete</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Del"><span class="fE ">Del - Delete</span></a>

These two keys will delete everything under the cursor. The
current character is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__End"><span class="fE ">End - L/R Corner</span></a>

End will jump the cursor to the lower-right corner of the entire
vlayer.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Enter2"><span class="fE ">Enter - Character</span></a>

Enter will alter the current character on the vlayer. Select it
from a menu and then press Enter to confirm your choice.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__ESC"><span class="fE ">ESC - Exit/Cancel Mode</span></a>

ESC will exit vlayer mode. If you are in block, text, or draw
mode, ESC will instead cancel the current mode and return to
normal vlayer editing.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Home"><span class="fE ">Home - U/L Corner</span></a>

Home will jump the cursor to the upper-left corner of the
entire vlayer.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Ins"><span class="fE ">Ins - Grab</span></a>

Ins will select the character and color under the cursor
as the current. The actual character is not affected.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Sp"><span class="fE ">Spacebar - Place</span></a>

Spacebar will copy the current character and color to the
location under the cursor. Other characters will be deleted if
they are under the cursor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__Tab"><span class="fE ">Tab - Draw</span></a>

Tab will toggle the current draw mode. When drawing is on, you
will place a copy of the current character every time you move
the cursor.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__CtrG"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+G - Goto Position</span></a>

Ctrl+G will pop up a window, displaying target x,y coordinates.
Set the coordinates by either typing in or selecting the
desired X and Y values, and select OK to go to those coordinates
on the vlayer. Choosing Cancel or pressing Escape cancels.

<span class="fE ">P - Change Buffer Character</span>

P will act much like Enter, but only change the character in the
buffer. No character on the vlayer is changed with this action.

<span class="fE ">Alt+Z - Clear (Vlayer)</span>

Alt+Z will clear the vlayer entirely. You will be asked for
confirmation. Clearing the vlayer will clear the vlayer undo
history as well.

<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__CtrZ"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Z - Undo</span></a>
<a class="helpanchor" name="VLAYER.HLP__CtrY"><span class="fE ">Ctrl+Y - Redo</span></a>

Ctrl+Z will undo an action; Ctrl+Y will redo any previously
undone action. Action depth is determined by config file
settings, with 100 as default.

---

On top of being modifiable in the editor, the vlayer can be
changed in a running MZX world with Robotic. To manipulate the
vlayer in Robotic, "#n" is used instead of pure numbers in copy
commands. For example, if copying a 2x2 block from (6,6) of the
board to (0,0) of the vlayer is wanted, the command would be:

<span class="fE ">COPY BLOCK 6 6 2 2 "#0" "#0"</span>

Here are the vlayer copy functions:

Board to vlayer: <span class="fA ">COPY BLOCK x1 y1 w h "#x2" "#y2"</span>
Overlay to vlayer: <span class="fA ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK x1 y1 w h "#x2" "#y2"</span>
Vlayer to board: <span class="fA ">COPY BLOCK "#x1" "#y1" w h x2 y2</span>
Vlayer to overlay: <span class="fA ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK "#x1" "#y1" w h x2 y2</span>

In the commands below, <span class="fe ">COPY BLOCK</span><span class="ff "> and </span><span class="fe ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK</span>
are interchangeable.

Vlayer to MZM:
<span class="fA ">COPY (OVERLAY) BLOCK "#x1" "#y1" w h "@name.mzm" m</span>
Vlayer to string:
<span class="fA ">COPY (OVERLAY) BLOCK "#x1" "#y1" w h "$stringN" c</span>
Vlayer to itself:
<span class="fA ">COPY (OVERLAY) BLOCK "#x1" "#y1" w h "#x2" "#y2"</span>

"m" and "c" can be any value but must exist.

There are several ways to give the vlayer working coordinates:

Pure numbers - <span class="fE ">"#xxx"</span>
Counter value - <span class="fE ">"#&counter&"</span>
Expressions - <span class="fE ">"#('counter' + x)"</span>

MZMs can be placed on the vlayer by using p02. Example:

<span class="fE ">PUT "@visuals.mzm" image_file p02 x y</span>

Reading and writing single characters or colors from the vlayer
requires the vch and vco counters.

For reading and writing characters use <span class="fE ">"vchX,Y"</span><span class="fF ">.</span>
For reading and writing colors use <span class="fE ">"vcoX,Y"</span><span class="fF ">.</span>

For example:

<span class="fE ">SET "vch10,10" '+'</span><span class="ff "> sets the vlayer char at (10,10) to a plus</span>
sign.
<span class="fE ">SET "vco10,10" 15</span><span class="ff "> sets the vlayer color at (10,10) to white on</span>
black.
<span class="fE ">SET "temp" "vch10,10"</span><span class="ff "> sets temp to whatever the character at</span>
(10,10) of the vlayer is.

Vlayer size can be changed by setting the counter "vlayer_size"
to the desired length of the vlayer. Doing this only sets the
maximum size; the actual vlayer will not be this large unless
the vlayer's dimensions are changed. All attempts to set the
vlayer's size above the maximum will be ignored.

To change the vlayer's dimensions in Robotic, use the counters
"vlayer_width" and "vlayer_height". When one dimension is
given, the other becomes as large as possible to fill the given
vlayer. For example, if one has a vlayer 50000 characters large
and sets vlayer_height to 499, the vlayer's width will become
100 characters wide (for a total vlayer size of 49900
characters).

All bad values of vlayer_size, vlayer_height and vlayer_width
(0 and below) will be changed to 1.

Remember that the vlayer is global. If many vlayers are wanted,
liberal usage of MZM saving and loading can help get around this
problem.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Using MZMs</span></p>
MZM files are rough equivalents of the ANSI files used in older
MZX versions. MZMs, however, are much more powerful and can
store much more information. MZMs can be up to 65535 x 65535
tiles in size. MZMs are useful for easy access of reused
graphics and reused, multi-Robot entities.

MZMs come in two modes: "board" and "layer".
  * Board mode saves color, param, ID, and under information.
    However, it cannot save the player, scrolls or sensors.
    Board mode can save Robots and most built-ins; MZMs saved
    in the editor will save fresh robots, while MZMs saved
    in-game keep the Robots' current states.
  * Layer mode saves only color and char information.

Any information not saveable will be replaced by a customblock
facsimile.

When loading a board MZM file to the overlay or vlayer, the
character used is the parameter stored. Outside of customblocks
and related, different characters could appear due to different
param settings (especially built-ins and Robots).

One can save MZMs in the editor; use the block action function.
MZMs saved in the editor from the board are saved as board;
from the overlay and vlayer, MZMs are always saved as layer.

Robotic methods of saving MZMs are:

<span class="fA ">COPY BLOCK x y w h "@filename" p</span>
<span class="fA ">COPY OVERLAY BLOCK x y w h "@filename" p</span>
<span class="fA ">COPY (OVERLAY) BLOCK "#x" "#y" w h "@filename" m</span>

X/Y are the coordinates of the block's upper-left corner; w/h
are the width and height of the block; filename is the name of
the file (the @ is required); finally, p determines the MZM
type. 1 saves as layer; 0 saves as board. 0 is integral for
copying non-graphical data (especially Robots); 1 is proper for
copying graphical data, as the block's appearance will stay as
exactly as it was when saved. The last case is for saving from
the vlayer to MZM. The x,y coordinates MUST be in "#x" "#y"
format, and the m can be any value but MUST exist. Any valid MZX
string can take the place of a filename, but the @ prefix is
still required.

Unlike with board MZMs containing Robots saved in the editor,
loading board MZMs containing runtime Robots in the editor is
unsupported. Any such Robot will be replaced with a customblock
fascimilie. If you want any such MZMs to be fully loaded, they
must also be loaded at runtime.

The Robotic method of loading MZMs is:

<span class="fA ">PUT "@filename" image_file pNN x y</span>

filename is the name of the MZM file (after the required @),
x and y are the upper-left corner's coordinates, and NN is 00
for board, 01 for overlay, 02 for vlayer. Again, any valid
string can take the place of a filename if preceded by the
required @ prefix.

Finally, MZMs will neither be saved nor loaded if at the edge
of a board.

<div class="helpfile" id="TRIG.HLP">
<a class="helpanchor" name="TRIG.HLP__tri"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Trigonometric Functions</span></p>
Trigonometry can simplify some complex engines, and MegaZeux
can access several trigonometric functions with fair precision.
However, accessing trigonometric functions in MegaZeux requires
some setup.

Because MegaZeux works solely with integers, you need to set
the counter "multiplier" to determine how the non-integer
working value is converted. For example, if your function
has a value of .86602 and "multiplier" is set to 10000, the
resulting value would be 8660. Results are always truncated
(that is, have everything to the right of the decimal removed).
The default value for the "multiplier" counter is 10000.

The counter "c_divisions" determines the precision of the trig
functions by determining how many times the circle is divided.
Sensible values for this include 360 (degree precision), 21600
(arc-minute precision) and 1296000 (arc-second precision). The
default value for the "c_divisions" counter is 360.

The "divider" counter works solely on inverse trigonometric
functions. Its effect is to divide the number passed to an
inverse function before it is calculated. For example, if you
have "divider" set to 100 and try to calculate "acos50", MZX
will calculate the arccosine of .50 (50 divided by 100),
outputting 60 degrees. The default value for the "divider"
counter is 10000.

These are the trig functions MegaZeux can directly utilize.

<span class="fA ">SIN - sine</span>
<span class="fA ">COS - cosine</span>
<span class="fA ">TAN - tangent</span>
<span class="fA ">ASIN - arcsine (inverse sine)</span>
<span class="fA ">ACOS - arccosine (inverse cosine)</span>
<span class="fA ">ATAN - arctangent (inverse tangent, takes signs into account)</span>
<span class="fA ">ARCTAN - atan2 (special form of arctangent, takes two values</span>
<span class="fA ">in the form of ARCTANdy,dx ("dy" is the first input, "dx" the</span>
<span class="fA ">second))</span>

NOTE: The inverse functions output degrees, not radians.

To use the counters you put the unit number after the counter
name. Here's an example. To display the cosine of 30 degrees
with degree-based precision, the needed line would be:

<span class="fE ">* "&cos30&"</span>

Trig functions can also take expressions and counters. However,
counters can only be inserted through expressions; a construct
like "&sinlocal&" will not work, but "&sin('local')&" will.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Cycles and Board Scans - How MZX Processes Robots</span></p>
Knowing MZX's commands is important for coding, obviously, but
knowing how and when they get executed can be just as
paramount.

After executing code in the global Robot, MegaZeux executes
Robotic code by scanning the board from the top-leftmost Robot
first, then proceeding from left-to-right, jumping down to the
beginning of the next line when at the end of its current line,
and ending at the Robot in the bottom-right corner. This action
is called a BOARD SCAN. MegaZeux then does a clean-up scan in
reverse to catch certain actions. This complete act of scanning
a board and executing any Robotic commands is called a CYCLE,
and when a Robot completes all of its commands for that cycle,
it's called ENDING A CYCLE for that Robot. After a cycle is
executed, the display is updated, so MegaZeux's internal frame
rate is essentially the same rate as the number of cycles
executed per second.

By default, MegaZeux will run up to 40 commands per Robot in a
cycle. Setting the COMMANDS counter can set the number of
commands processed per Robot per cycle to be lower or
(significantly) higher. Some commands, however, have the ability
to end processing prematurely; these are called cycle-ending
commands. When the COMMANDS value is very high, MegaZeux can end
up consuming large amounts of processing power in a single
cycle. Cycle-ending commands can limit the number of commands
processed in a cycle to only what is necessary. Otherwise, very
high COMMANDS values can potentially slow down MegaZeux or even
cause MegaZeux to trigger safeguards that prevent it from
freezing.

The two commands that are best suited for ending the cycle are
WAIT 1 and CYCLE 1, because of their very low amounts of side
effects. While WAIT 1 is preferred in most cases, mostly due to
being far more intuitive, there is a subtle difference between
processing the two due to its quirk with reverse scan detailed
later in this section.

As a simple rule of thumb, commands that move anything on the
board generally end a cycle, especially moving the player,
though this is not always the case.

The amount of cycles MegaZeux processes per second is set by the
MZX_SPEED value. Speed 1 is completely processor-bound and will
execute as many cycles per second as possible. Other speeds
process cycles according to this formula:

<span class="fE ">62.5 / (MZX_SPEED - 1) = cycles per second</span>

Simplified, this means that MegaZeux can be set to consistent
rates ranging from 62 & 1/2 cycles per second (speed 2) all the
way down to 4 & 1/6 cycles per second (speed 16).

The CYCLE command dictates how often a Robot is active. By
default, Robots will execute commands on every cycle, but the
CYCLE command can cause a Robot to spend a certain number of
cycles idling before executing commands. Robots can go from
executing 1 out of every 1 cycles (i.e. every cycle) to 1 out
of every 255.

Special care should be given to the scan that happens in reverse
to clean up certain actions. This scan ensures that if a Robot
sends a Robot that has already executed its commands to a label,
then the target Robot can actually be sent to the proper label.
Certain commands in the target Robot - specifically, the
cycle-ending commands that can act across multiple cycles - can
cause that Robot to execute the new label commands in the very
same cycle. The global Robot is exempt from this process.

Commands that can prompt this behavior are:

<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP____5">/ "string"</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___e1">END</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___g4">GO [dir] #</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___t7">TRY [dir] "label"</a>
<a class="helplink" href="#COMMANDR.HLP___w1">WAIT #</a>

For more detailed information about what commands end cycles and
when, read cycles_and_commands.txt in the additional
documentation.

<a class="helpanchor" name="PARTIAL.HLP__par"> </a>
<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">Partial Character Sets</span></p>
Partial character sets are smaller than full sets, as the name
definitely implies, but they only overwrite the characters they
are told to when loaded. This leaves the rest of the characters
intact. Heavy animations and changes that keep part of the
character set intact (such as the alphanumeric characters) are
two issues best tackled with partial character sets.

One can save a partial character set in the editor by selecting
a starting character value (aka "offset") and a length value.
These fields show up when you export a character set, under the
filename input.

To load partial character sets into your current set, you have
two options. You can firstly load it as you would a normal
character set; this replaces all characters from the start of
the target character set until the end of the partial set.
Secondly, you can load the partial set into a non-0 position of
the target character set. In the editor, this can be done by
setting the offset field in the import character dialog, under
the filename input. The @xxxx prefix allows this in Robotic;
xxxx is the number (in decimal) of the first character to
replace in the target character set.

<p class="helpcentered"><span class="f9 ">The MegaZeux Updater</span></p>
Modern MegaZeux versions on supported platforms, such as
Windows, have the ability to update MegaZeux from MegaZeux
itself. The updater can be set to run by pressing either F7 or U
on any title screen, and can also be configured to check for
updates every launch in config.txt settings.

MegaZeux checks the sites listed under the config.txt settings,
in order. By default, the updater checks the Stable branch of
MegaZeux, but can be set in config.txt to other branches (such
as Unstable or Debytecode).

If a host reports back that your version of MegaZeux is current,
the next host can be checked to see if they differ.

If a new version of MegaZeux is detected, MegaZeux offers the
user these choices:
-Upgrading to the new version using the "Upgrade" button.
-Updating the current version to whatever minor "refreshed"
 version may exist (where the version number remains the same,
 but a small issue or two not caught before release is fixed)
 using the "Update Old" button.
-Cancelling out of the update process with the "Cancel" button.
 No changes are made.
 
Once the option is chosen, MegaZeux lists what files will be
added, changed, or deleted by the pending update. At this point,
the user can still cancel out of updating with the Escape key.
Pressing Enter at this point begins the updating process.

The updater will then attempt to download the necessary files
for the update. The download indicator lists the current file
being downloaded, its size in bytes, and current file number
out of total files to be downloaded. If all files are properly
downloaded, MegaZeux will apply the update and notify the user
of a restart. Click "OK" and MegaZeux will restart, fully
updated.

September 23rd, 2019 - MZX 2.92b

This release fixes several bugs, notably 3DS and Wii rendering
issues and a bug where the wrong palette would be saved while
COLOR FADE OUT was active. Also in this release are performance
and usability improvements for the NDS and 3DS ports and a new
frontend for HTML5/Emscripten builds (special thanks to asie).

USERS

+ Fixed a bug where mouse warping both mouse coordinates would
  not actually warp both coordinates.
+ Fixed a port regression where save files would be saved with
  the wrong color intensities while COLOR FADE OUT was active
  (or during the first cycle of a board for <2.90 worlds). This
  fixes fading bugs in Ruin Diver 3.
+ Added compatibility for a bug where the robot message box
  would disable COLOR FADE OUT in versions 2.83 through 2.90X.
  This fixes several BKZX games.
+ Fixed checkres bugs separately preventing detection of global
  robots in both world formats.
+ Fixed 3DS renderer bug where the UI wouldn't properly display
  char foregrounds with extended graphics enabled.
+ Fixed 3DS renderer bug where sprites containing chars with
  transparent foregrounds wouldn't draw any char backgrounds.
+ Fixed 3DS renderer crashes that would occur when large numbers
  of sprites were active.
+ Improved file manager directory read times for 3DS/NDS/Wii.
+ File IO for world saving/loading is now buffered, which should
  improve save/load times on the 3DS and Switch.
+ Enabled writing zip data descriptors for the Switch.
+ Added classic/stretch video ratio support for the 3DS and NDS
  lower screens. (asie)
+ "classic" is now the default ratio for the 3DS, NDS, and Wii.
+ Fixed GX renderer bug where chars with both colors transparent
  could cause various graphical bugs in normal MZX mode.
+ Fixed bug where board exits could be cleared when deleting a
  board or after loading a world containing null boards.
+ Fixed bugs when playing STARDSTM.GDM with the libxmp engine.
+ Fixed a crash that could occur when importing a world in the
  editor containing a null board.
+ Fixed a bug where null boards wouldn't be properly refactored
  on the NDS while using a memory cart, causing entrances to
  point to the wrong boards and possibly other problems.
+ Fixed a bug that could corrupt the ends of robot programs when
  using an NDS memory cart.
+ Improved world loading times when using an NDS memory cart.
+ Improved NDS memory cart transfer speed. (asie)
+ Disabled NDS logging hacks when stdio redirect is enabled.
+ Exiting MZX on the NDS should now power off the NDS.
+ Added Emscripten frontend. (asie)
+ Fixed bug where errors in the title screen Load World window
  could clear the rest of the screen.
+ Fixed crash that could occur when attempting to load an
  invalid zip world.
+ Non-recursive directory deletion in the file manager now tries
  to delete the directory itself instead of its contents. Added
  error messages for failed file and directory deletes.

DEVELOPERS

+ Added initial support for the dirent d_type field to help
  avoid stat calls when reading directories.
+ Replaced most fseek calls in the legacy world loader.
+ Refactored move_current_board to be more readable.
+ Corrected some of the editor's bad extram handling and added
  warnings to debug builds to help debug it (no platforms at the
  present support both the editor and extram).
+ Replaced error wait_event() with update_event_status_delay().
+ Added preliminary VFS code to replace function pointer casting
  in zip.c.
+ Fixed Wayland/X11 detection for setups that don't allow X or
  Xorg to be run normally.
+ Unix builds should now attempt to load the icon from the
  installed path instead of from a hardcoded path. Builds with
  no sharedir set will use "contrib/icons/quantump.png" instead.

July 22nd, 2019 - MZX 2.92

Here's another inexcusably big minor version release. First off,
there are two new ports (Switch and Emscripten) and the Android
port has been updated to be actually usable. Second, joystick
support has been significantly overhauled (and depending on the
controller/joystick you plug in, it may work with no config
settings required!). Game joystick settings should no longer
override the new UI joystick behavior. Also, controllers can now
be used directly via Robotic. Read docs/joystick.html for more
information on the new features.

Other changes of note include RAD music support (v1 and v2),
palette editor improvements, and some new counters. There's a
new SDL 2 exclusive renderer to replace overlay1/overlay2 called
"softscale" that performs much better than either did and with
fewer crashes. Also of note are the massive number of fixed bugs
and compatibility improvements, fixing regressions and error
messages that affected around 20 different games (or more). A
major bug was fixed that caused the updater to not initialize
in Windows has been fixed too, so basically, update already.

FEATURES

+ Added numerous improvements to MZX's joystick handling:
  + Joystick inputs can now be bound to generic actions. These
    actions correspond to XInput buttons and can interact with
    MegaZeux's various windows in a context-specific manner.
    They can be used directly in Robotic with the new counter
    "joy#.[action]" or can be bound to keycodes in the config
    file to allow them to be used with older games. The NDS,
    3DS, Wii, PSP, and GP2X pad.config files have been updated
    to use actions. See the help file or config file for more
    info on the config options and available actions.
  + Added automatic joystick mapping for Windows/Mac/Linux/etc.
    Joysticks recognized as SDL game controllers are assigned
    joystick actions when detected. This behavior can be altered
    or disabled via config options.
  + New counter: "joy#active" will return 1 if a given joystick
    is availabled, 0 if not, and -1 if the index is invalid.
  + New counter: "joy_simulate_keys". When set to 1 (default),
    joysticks can produce simulated key presses, as in older MZX
    versions. When set to 0, this behavior is disabled.
  + Joystick settings in game.cnf files are now loaded as game-
    specific joystick bindings. These bindings will no longer
    override global/UI bindings defined by the config file or
    pad.config. The default bindings are restored when any world
    is loaded from the title screen; they are not restored when
    a save is loaded, between world swaps, or in the editor.
  + Joystick config options can be assigned to key names in the
    format of "key_X" (without quotes), where X is the key name.
  + Joystick config options for a particular controller now work
    with ranges of controllers e.g. "joy[1,16].lshoulder = 13".
  + Added the config setting "joy_axis_threshold". This setting
    allows the threshold for joystick axis mapped presses to be
    configured.
  + The NDS directional pad is now considered a joystick hat.
  + The 3DS directional pad is now considered a joystick hat.
    The circle pad is now mappable as axes 1 and 2.
  + The Wii Classic Controller triggers are now recognized as
    axes 7 and 8. The Guitar Hero axes have been shifted to 9,
    10, and 11, and a likely bug with the whammy bar axis has
    been fixed. The Gamecube controller triggers are recognized
    as axes 5 and 6, and all 8 controllers now have default
    bindings in pad.config.
+ Added/updated Android port. (asie)
+ Added Emscripten port. (asie)
+ Added Nintendo Switch port. (Lachesis, asie)
+ The main menu and game menu are now usable with keyboard,
  mouse, or joystick. Pressing a navigation key/joystick button
  or clicking an option in these menus will enable a cursor to
  select one of the options. Most listed options are selectable
  unless disabled by the current game, in which case they will
  be hidden from the menu entirely. However, the settings and
  exit options appear regardless of their respective counters.
+ MegaZeux now supports Reality Adlib Tracker (RAD) music files.
  Both 1.x and 2.x variants are fully supported.
+ New counter: TIME_MILLIS. Returns the milliseconds of the
  current system time.
+ New counters: MOD_LOOPSTART and MOD_LOOPEND. These counters
  return the start and end of the loop for the current playing
  music and can be set to change the loop while the music is
  playing. Setting MOD_LOOPEND to 0 disables the loop. These
  counters only work for Ogg Vorbis and WAV audio (not modules).
+ Added support for the LOOPEND tag for Ogg Vorbis files. This
  tag can be used to define the end of the loop directly, which
  may be more convenient for some users. This tag takes lower
  precedence than LOOPLENGTH if both are present, and will be
  ignored if its value is less than LOOPSTART.
+ The SPR#_OFF counter is now readable through Robotic.
+ New sprite counter: SPR#_Z. Sprites are displayed in order
  of their z value. Sprites with a higher z value will appear in
  front of sprites with a lower z value. This ordering takes
  precedence over both Y ordering (if SPR_YORDER is enabled) and
  sprite number. Removes the need to use SPR#_SWAP for managing
  sprite draw order. (Lancer-X)
+ New counters: FREAD_LENGTH and FWRITE_LENGTH. These counters
  return the length of the FREAD file/directory (if open) or the
  current length of the FWRITE file (if open).
+ New counter: SET "$string" "SAVE_ROBOT". This does the same
  thing as SET "filename" "SAVE_ROBOT", except it saves the
  robot to the specified string.
+ The default boot.dol for Wii builds with the editor enabled
  is now MegaZeux instead of MZXRun.
+ New GLSL scaling shader: "sai". This shader implements the
  "Scale 2xSaI" algorithm by Kreed with a modified interpolation
  function to produce sharper edges. This shader can scale up to
  any size larger than 640x350 and is comparable to hqscale
  (though it should look and perform a little better).
+ Fullscreen mode will now attempt to match a supported screen
  resolution if no "fullscreen_resolution" setting is specified.
  For scaling renderers, this favors the current desktop
  resolution. For "software", this favors smaller resolutions.
+ Added the config setting "fullscreen_windowed". When set to 1,
  MZX will create a borderless window with the current desktop
  resolution instead of regular fullscreen. Disabled by default.
+ Added the config setting "grab_mouse". When set to 1, MZX will
  trap the mouse cursor within the window while the window is
  active. Disabled by default.
+ The current renderer can now be set from the settings menu.
+ Added the 'softscale' renderer. This renderer is a generalized
  rewrite of the former SDL 2 overlay renderer implementation.
  It should perform significantly better and be more portable.
+ Added several palette editor usability improvements:
  + The current color stored with F2 is now displayed in the
    bottom-right corner of the palette editor help menu.
  + In SMZX mode 2 or 3 editing, the four colors of the current
    subpalette can be stored with F5. Stored subpalette colors
    can be placed at the current subpalette with F6. These are
    stored independently of the stored current color. The help
    menu color display will cycle through the stored colors.
  + In SMZX mode 3 editing, the current subpalette's indices can
    be stored with F7 and placed at the current subpalette with
    F8. The stored indices are displayed in the help menu next
    to the stored color display.
  + The shortcut for toggling the subpalette cursors has been
    changed to Insert. The subpalette cursors are now displayed
    in SMZX mode 3 editing and are enabled by default.
  + Palettes (and/or indices) can be imported into and exported
    from the palette editor with Alt+I and Alt+X, respectively.
  + Added a secondary editor-only palette which can be switched
    to with Tab. This palette is not saved with any world, but
    can be edited and imported to/exported from and can be used
    to copy colors/subpalettes between different sources.
+ checkres now displays the board, sfx, and robot (with line and
  position on the board) each file was referenced in.
+ checkres can now be used with a directory as the base file.
  Like a ZIP archive, checkres will recursively search the
  directory for .MZX/.MZB files and display information for all
  of them.
+ checkres has more display options: only display missing (-M)
  (default), only display created (-C), only display found (-F),
  also display missing (-m), also display created (-c), and also
  display found (-f).
+ checkres can now wildcard match resources from commands that
  use expressions or interpolation in filenames. This can be
  enabled with -w or enabled exclusively with -W.
+ checkres can now display unused resources in a path/zip after
  the other resources are listed (-u), or display only unused
  resources (-U).
+ checkres can now display every reference to a particular
  resource in a world instead of just the first with varying
  levels of information (-v, -vv). Added the option -s, which
  is the default and equivalent to older versions of checkres,
  and -1 as an alternate flag for -q.
+ checkres can now sort its output either by the name of the
  expected resource file (-N) (default) or by the location in
  the world the file was referenced (-L).
+ checkres option flags can now be combined (e.g. -aL). This
  does not apply to the "-extra" and "-in" flags.
+ New config options: "test_mode" and "test_mode_start_board".
  If "test_mode" is set to 1, MegaZeux will start the given file
  in testing mode, exactly as if the user used Alt+T on the
  first board from the editor. Setting "test_mode_start_board"
  to a valid board number in the world will start instead from
  that board. Exiting testing will exit MegaZeux entirely.
- SDL 2 support for the overlay renderers has been removed. When
  specified for video_output, softscale will be enabled instead.
- Removed WAV from the list of board mod extensions.

FIXES

+ SET "$string" TO "fwrite" will now always write the delimiter
  regardless of the length of $string. Previously, this command
  would only write a delimiter if $string was a length greater
  than zero, requiring extra checks by the user to account for
  this special case. Compatibility checks have been added for
  for worlds made in older versions.
+ Fixed bug where robots attempting to copy the player over
  themselves with COPY x y x y or COPY dir dir would get stuck
  in an infinite loop instead of executing the next command.
+ SPR_YORDER and the sprite collision list are properly saved
  and loaded from saves again.
+ The SPR_NUM counter now has the full range of a regular
  counter and is saved. Out-of-range values are ignored for the
  purposes of its legacy IF and PUT uses. This only affects
  2.92+ worlds. Additionally, 2.65 through 2.69c worlds treat
  its range as -128 through 127, fixing a bug in Sprite Catcher.
+ The active sprites count is properly updated when SPR#_OFF is
  set and is properly loaded from saves again. This value can be
  viewed from the variable debug screen now, though it may be
  inaccurate for older saves.
+ Fixed various bugs related to the robot position not being
  internally tracked correctly. This could be caused by WALK,
  SWITCH dir dir, OPEN, MOVE ALL, moving through a transport,
  pushing, and rotation. This fixes issues with IF ALIGNEDROBOT,
  THISX, THISY, THIS_COLOR, PLAYERDIST, HORIZPLD, VERTPLD, RID#,
  ROBOT_ID_#, the robot's coordinates displayed in the counter
  and robot debuggers, and MZM saving. Due to the number of
  features affected by these bugs, the fix only affects worlds
  saved in 2.92 or later.
+ Fixed a regression where rotating could sometimes fail to
  rotate the player, sensors, pushable robots, or transports.
+ When a robot uses the OPEN command and is pushed through a
  transport, MZX no longer crashes or creates invalid robots.
+ Fixed crash that could sometimes occur when pressing Alt+Up
  while drawing near the top of a board in the editor.
+ Fixed bug where canceling 'Alt+C' char selection in the
  robot editor would comment the current line.
+ Fixed a bug where F5 in the robot editor would not print data
  for extended chars.
+ Clicking through board name windows and other interfaces with
  the mouse should no longer place the current buffer.
+ Fixed a bug where the updater could fail to initialize due to
  a relative argv[0] in Windows. MegaZeux attempts to get the
  executable path from Win32 first now.
+ Improved warning message when no HTTP response is received.
+ The software renderer no longer tries to use an SDL_Renderer
  to draw the surface returned by SDL_GetWindowSurface. This
  fixes a crash when switching to fullscreen with the software
  renderer on some platforms.
+ Fixed a software renderer mouse crash bug caused by moving the
  cursor off the screen with a window bigger than the screen.
+ Fixed a bug where setting SMZX_MESSAGE to 0 wouldn't always
  draw the message correctly.
+ If a referenced SAM or GDM file isn't present, MegaZeux will
  attempt to load a corresponding WAV or S3M (respectively) with
  the same filename minus the extension. This should fix some
  music/sounds in older games that referenced SAM/GDM files but
  were packed with the post-conversion WAV/S3M files only.
+ The behavior for reseting the player movement repeat timers
  has been reverted to requiring all four movement keys released
  (as in 2.80 to 2.91i). The related player locking fix has not
  been modified.
+ IF "&$string&" and COPY BLOCK # # # # "&$string&" now properly
  resolve &$string& before checking if the first operand or the
  copy destination are a string (respectively), bringing their
  behavior more in line with SET/INC/DEC and other commands.
+ Fixed a regression where the COLOR INTENSITY commands would
  update the screen if used the same cycle as TELEPORT PLAYER.
  This fixes a graphical issue in Thanatos Insignia.
+ Improved string wildcard comparison performance.
+ Changed the debug window to display "2.65/2.68" for worlds
  from MZX 2.65 and MZX 2.68. Features from 2.68 still check for
  the intended MZX 2.68 magic; the very few existing 2.68 worlds
  that use these features need to be resaved in 2.69.
+ MegaZeux now attempts to fix Robotic that fails bytecode
  validation. This resolves error messages and bugs in Eternal
  Eclipse Taoyarin v1.0, Loco, Manuel the Manx, SaintZZT 7th,
  Slave Pit, and Ep+Arp World MZX.
+ The MOD SAM command has been restored for compatibility and
  is version locked to <2.80 worlds. This fixes missing sound
  effects in Crisis in Stuffyou City (original), Sprite Catcher,
  and Talon's Tale. This only works for libxmp builds.
+ Fixed a sprite collision bounding bug where the collision
  height bounding for the reference checked using the collision
  width instead. This fixes Manuel the Manx.
+ Fixed several memory leaks in the editor related to editing,
  placing, grab, and undo/redo operations on robots and scrolls.
+ Fixed vlayer memory leak when loading 2.84 saves.
+ Fixed a regression where the 'if c?? Sprite' legacy fix wasn't
  locked to 2.69c and up. This fixes Depravity (2003 DoZ #666).
+ PUT Sprite now works unconditionally for <2.80 games, fixing
  bugs where games relied on placing 0-height sprites or placing
  sprites before initializing their dimensions: Hackers Can Turn
  Your Computer Into a Bomb!, Lethal Recurse (2003 DoZ #215),
  Serum (2003 DoZ #404), Trashman Dan (Summer 2004 DoZ #18349).
+ The LOCAL and LOCAL# counters are now versioned separately,
  fixing bugs in Freedom Bound (Summer 2000 DoZ #4096) and
  Impact (2001 DoZ #027).
+ SHOOT now properly updates the blocked array. This fixes a bug
  in Captain Proton and the Reality Rippers (1999 WEoZ #173).
+ Fixed a bug where the custom SFX flag and max samples wouldn't
  be reset when creating a new world in the editor.

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed -Wunused-result warnings for Linux builds.
+ Added "Intel EMGD" to auto_glsl blacklist (questionable
  OpenGL 2.0 support).
+ Added platform-independent joystick event functions and
  updated the SDL, NDS, 3DS, and Wii event handlers for them.
+ MinGW builds now use -Wl,-Bstatic and -Wl,-Bdynamic to enforce
  the preferred linking when both static and dynamic builds of
  libraries are present.
+ For MSYS2 shells, config.sh now chooses the prefix /mingw32
  or /mingw64 by default if $MSYSTEM is "MINGW32" or "MINGW64"
  and either the "win32" or "win64" arch is selected.
+ MegaZeux now uses the renderer free_video function on exit.
+ GL_LoadLibrary no longer fails if the library is already
  loaded in SDL 1.2. (Lancer-X)
+ GL renderers free textures and revert to fixed function
  pipeline where appropriate. (Lancer-X)
+ OpenGL ES support can now be enabled for SDL builds with the
  --enable-gles option. This option is force-enabled for
  platforms that only support OpenGL ES.
+ opengl1 renderer now always uses power of 2 textures, same as
  opengl2 and glsl. This provides a tiny performance improvement
  on most cards and a massive performance improvement on some
  other cards. (Lancer-X)
+ Added debug build sanitizer options for AddressSanitizer,
  MemorySanitizer, and ThreadSanitizer. MemorySanitizer requires
  clang and all currently require Linux/BSD/Mac OS X/similar.
  Support for all three is very experimental; they may require
  disabling options like modular builds or may not work at all.
+ Moved several param functions from robot.c to run_robot.c.
  Aside from a few exceptions, these functions are largely used
  in run_robot.c only. This should improve Robotic performance
  in release builds.
+ Updated MSVC project for Visual Studio 2019. (elig, Spectere)
+ Added experimental pledge(2) and unveil(2) support for OpenBSD
  builds. By default, this is enabled for the utils but not for
  MZX. Additionally, config.sh now detects OpenBSD properly and
  several warnings have been fixed.
+ Fixed faulty '!' rule logic in match_function_counter and
  changed 'key?' to 'key!' to prevent potential false matches.
- Removed uthash as a build option.

February 20th, 2019 - MZX 2.91j

Here's a huge collection of bugfixes and a couple of features
that needed to be split off from 2.92.

Features: every release has an HTML copy of the help file now,
the editor keeps separate board/overlay/vlayer buffers now, and
anyone who still uses scrolls/sensors can view their info in the
counter debugger. The global volume settings use an exponential
curve now, range from 0 to 10, and have updated UI elements.

Fixes in this release include: the updater won't complain about
mzx_help.fil anymore, the NDS and 3DS ports have keyboards that
work again, several bugs that would lead to worlds/saves with
"Robot # does not exist on board #" errors have been fixed, and
several crashes have been fixed.

USERS

+ A complete HTML copy of the MegaZeux help file is now packaged
  with releases for all platforms. It can be found in the docs/
  folder.
+ Nvidia and AMD switchable graphics drivers should now detect
  MegaZeux and MZXRun properly on Windows.
+ The editor now remembers the contents of the buffer when
  switching between board, overlay, and vlayer editing. For
  example, if a robot is selected on the board before switching
  to overlay mode, the robot will still be in the buffer when
  the user switches back to board mode.
+ The editor now remembers the last filename for importing and
  exporting MZM, MZB, CHR, PAL, and PALIDX files.
+ Scrolls and sensors can now be viewed in the counter debugger.
  They can be found by expanding the Board list (when present).
+ Readded "#version 110" directives to all GLSL shaders, fixing
  warnings on some Intel HD drivers. OpenGL ES builds should now
  comment out these directives.
+ Fixed bug where using Modify+Grab on built-ins could clear the
  floor under the built-in.
+ Fixed bug where key repeat wouldn't work for any text field in
  the NDS/3DS/Wii ports. This also affected the robot editor in
  Wii builds.
+ Fixed NDS touch screen support. Touching the screen no longer
  acts like escape and the keyboard properly works again.
+ Fixed a bug where the NDS keyboard would drop keypresses on
  games not running at speed 2.
+ The counter debugger now correctly displays the value of
  local0.
+ Fixed a bug where the counter debugger would not reopen to
  the correct robot local# value.
+ MZX now attempts to retry removal of an old file when updating
  if deletion fails initially. Error messages related to the
  failed deletion of "mzx_help.fil" or "assets/help.fil" are now
  suppressed as they are caused by a bug in older MZX versions.
+ The help file is now closed before the updater restarts MZX.
+ Fixed crash bug that could occur when removing old files after
  an update.
+ Improved manifest validity checks.
+ Fixed board editor crash caused by invalid thing IDs.
+ Player movement key repeat no longer resets when the player is
  locked. It will reset for a direction only when the arrow key
  corresponding to that direction is released. This fixes a bug
  in Brotherhood where the player would move at a fraction of
  the speed they were supposed to while swimming.
+ Added version checking for legacy IF c?? Sprite behavior. In
  versions 2.82b and prior, c?? would make this command ignore
  the provided param and use SPR_NUM instead. This fixes Project
  MoveZig.
+ Fixed spelling error in missile param dialog.
+ Switching boards in the editor now properly translates the new
  board's mod name, fixing cases where board mods would restart
  sometimes.
+ Fixed a bug where the current board mod wouldn't play after
  starting a listening mod, testing, returning to the editor,
  and then disabling the listening mod.
+ Replaced the linear volume setting curve with an exponential
  curve to make lower volumes less loud. The volume settings can
  now be set from 0 to 10 instead of from 1 to 8.
+ The config file setting pc_speaker_on=0 no longer prevents
  turning on PC speaker SFX at runtime.
+ Added temporary workaround for numpad 5 key detection when
  numlock is disabled.
+ "Forest to floor" and "Collect bombs" are properly enabled
  again for new boards by default. This fix doesn't alter config
  settings or saved .editor.cnf defaults.
+ The "Downver. world (MZX)" option in the "Export as" dialog
  is now completely highlighted when selected. (Lancer-X)
+ Starting MegaZeux with "startup_editor=1" no longer loads the
  default palette over the startup world's palette.
+ The move block action and undo/redo operations should now
  preserve the element beneath the player.
+ Fixed crashes caused by using block actions or COPY BLOCK on
  the player while the player is standing on a sensor.
+ Fixed several bugs where editor block actions and the commands
  COPY/COPY BLOCK would not check for the player or clean up
  robots/scrolls/sensors. Worlds/saves saved after these bugs
  occured could display "Robot # does not exist on board"
  errors when loaded.
+ The DUPLICATE SELF x y and DUPLICATE SELF dir commands now
  properly check for the player before attempting to duplicate
  a robot. This fixes a bug where MZX could create saves with
  "Robot # does not exist on board" errors.
+ Fixed a crash that could occur when importing a new board.
+ Fixed a bug where the 3DS onscreen keyboard would send key
  releases instead of key presses.
+ The 3DS onscreen keyboard now returns shifted chars when shift
  is active.
+ Fixed a bug where the libxmp implementation of MOD_ORDER and
  JUMP MOD ORDER could not restart the current order.
+ Fixed a crash with the libxmp implementation of MOD_POSITION
  when providing an out-of-bounds value.
+ Fixed a bug where Ctrl+[key] shortcuts would not work while a
  dialog list element was active on the Wii.
+ Fixed a bug where setting the board mod/charset/palette could
  truncate the first letter of the path on the Wii.
+ "mask_midchars" no longer masks the non-text char 127.
+ The message box title and the command [ now properly display
  the graphic for char 9 instead of a tab.
+ Added newline escaping to robot, counter, and string names in
  the counter debugger to work around formatting bugs.

DEVELOPERS

+ Added the hlp2html utility, which can be used to convert
  WIPHelp.txt into web and printable HTML files.
+ Updated to latest NDS ARM7 template.
+ Updated SDL2 for Windows release builds to SDL 2.0.9.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

December 9th, 2018 - MZX 2.91i

A small release with a bunch of fixes for bugs introduced mostly
within the past few versions. Other highlights: joysticks should
be hot pluggable now and Alt shortcuts now also work with the
command key in Mac builds.

USERS

+ MZX now properly detects when joysticks are connected and
  disconnected at runtime for platforms using SDL 2.
+ Fixed bug where the robot editor would open with the cursor at
  the end of the line instead of the start of the line.
+ Fixed a bug where the robot box could display using MZX mode
  but SMZX colors if opened on the first frame SMZX was enabled.
+ The built-in text box title should display correctly again in
  SMZX modes.
+ Fixed regression where keys could trigger wrong "keyN" labels.
+ Alt+F2 can now be used to open the settings dialog.
+ Mac users can now optionally use command in place of alt.
+ Improved editor cursor color selection for SMZX modes 2 and 3.

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed make test for SDL 1.2 builds.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

November 14th, 2018 - MZX 2.91h

A minor release primarily focused on improving counter/string
lookups and fixing bugs in the robot editor and counter debug
menu.

USERS

+ auto_glsl correctly switches to glsl on startup now.
+ Fix bug where "(editor)" wouldn't always display in the
  caption when editing.
+ The single line macro dialog now allows the full size of the
  single line macros to be edited. This fixes a crash caused by
  having a macro configured to be longer than the edit box could
  display.
+ Setting a counter to a string no longer duplicates the entire
  string in memory.
+ Fixed faulty BOARD_X and BOARD_Y bounding for values greater
  than the board width or height. Fixes potential crashes with
  BOARD_CHAR, BOARD_COLOR, BOARD_ID, and BOARD_PARAM.
+ The value of SPR_YORDER is now correctly displayed in the
  counter debug menu.
+ Improved the performance of the counter debug search.
+ Fixed cosmetic counter debug menu issue where the the "String"
  tree appeared to be expandable/collapsable when empty.
+ Fixed faulty substring searching algorithm used in the counter
  debug menu search and for breakpoints.
+ Added "Search" and "Cancel" buttons to the counter debug menu
  search so it can be used with the mouse.
+ When testing from the editor, if "__test.mzx" exists MegaZeux
  will now choose a numbered name for this world backup (e.g.
  "__test2.mzx") instead of potentially overwriting work.
+ Fixed bug where six-digit line numbers would display in the
  robot editor incorrectly.
+ Inserting text in the robot editor using the F2/F3/F4/F5
  shortcuts can no longer exceed the line length limit, fixing
  related crashes.
+ Using F5 in the robot editor generates decimal numbers instead
  of hex numbers now.
+ Fixed robot editor bug where pressing delete at the end of a
  line wouldn't join lines unless the current line was empty.
+ Restored the ability to use the F7/F8 cheats outside of the
  editor. This feature was broken in 2.91g. To enable cheats
  outside of the editor, the config option "allow_cheats" must
  now be set to "mzxrun" or 1. The former will enable them for
  MZXRun only (same as from 2.82b to 2.91f) and the latter will
  enable them for both executables (same as the -t flag in DOS
  versions).
+ Fixed bounding bug on the "board_default_width" and
  "board_default_height" config file options.
+ Separated robot editor "Search and Replace" dialog into a
  "Search" dialog and a "Replace" dialog. Both dialogs are
  smaller in size than the original. The order of the elements
  in these dialogs has also been altered to be more user-
  friendly. The hotkey for the new replace dialog is Ctrl+H.
+ Fixed Ctrl+R repeating for the "Replace All" robot editor
  search operation. Previously, it would act like "Replace".
+ Canceling the robot editor search/replace menus no longer
  disables the repeat feature.
+ Searching in the robot editor now properly preserves the case
  of the search string if case sensitive search is disabled.
+ Fixed bug where toggling the robot debugger position wouldn't
  take effect immediately.
+ Exiting the editor with the "startup_editor" config setting
  enabled should no longer inappropriately close MZX.
+ Selecting "tile" for the char editor import mode works again.
+ The bounds for the main editor charset import/export offsets
  and size have been increased to allow for extended charset
  values.
+ Fixed the "KEY?" labels for keys that no longer have a unicode
  representation in SDL2.
+ Fixed SET "$string" "FWRITE#" bug where, if # exceeded the
  length of $string, the output would be clipped to the wrong
  length.
+ The missile color ID char is now correctly set back to its
  default value when a new world is created from the editor.

DEVELOPERS

+ Cleaned up the counter debug menu code.
+ Switched from uthash to a modified version of khash for
  counter and string lookups. Counters/strings now consume less
  memory and counter/string lookups should perform slightly
  better on most platforms.
+ Replaced toupper/tolower in memcasecmp and substring searching
  with a lookup table-based implementation of tolower.
+ Refactored the following contexts to use the main loop: robot
  editor, intake, thing menu. For compatibility purposes the old
  intake still exists, but all robot editor hacks have been
removed from it.

October 7th, 2018 - MZX 2.91g

This bugfix release fixes various minor-to-moderate bugs in
various areas of MegaZeux. The title/game update code has gone
through a fairly major overhaul and several parts of MegaZeux
have been combined to use the same loop. The conversion of
MegaZeux's interfaces to be compatible with this loop is an
ongoing process expected to occur over several versions.

USERS

+ Added "allow_screenshots" config file option. Setting this
  option to 0 will disable the built-in screenshot feature.
+ The F12 key can now be detected by Robotic.
+ Loading saves from the title screen no longer resets TIME.
+ Loading saves from the title screen no longer erroneously
  changes the player restart position.
+ Swapping worlds now sets the correct TIME and player restart
  position values.
+ Fixed a bug where the fade out effect from COLOR FADE OUT
  would be reset after any Robotic dialog.
+ Undo for overlay and vlayer mouse drawing now works properly.
+ Mouse drawing in the editor now draws smooth lines instead of
  lines with gaps.
+ Fixed move block bug when the source and destination both
  overlapped the player.
+ Palette editor component entry now accepts most of the same
  inputs as dialog number boxes.
+ The board name in the caption now updates to reflect the
  current board while testing.
+ Fixed bug where TIME would either decrement normally or not
  decrement at all while the slow time effect was active.
+ Added compatibility for pre-port endgame teleport behavior.
  In DOS versions of MZX, the endgame teleport would disable
  itself after being triggered for the first time and any
  following endgame would instead trigger a game over.
+ Reduced stutter in NDS and 3DS main screen scrolling.
+ Fixed a bug where creating a string MZM would not correctly
  set the string's length for preexisting strings.
+ Fixed a bug where loading robot source code from a string
  wouldn't work correctly with the robot debugger.
+ The help system is now accessible from the main menu and game
  menu.
+ The settings screen is now accessible from the main menu, game
  menu, editor, and palette editor.
+ The shortcut Ctrl+F2 can be used to open the settings screen
  from anywhere the settings screen is accessible. This shortcut
  works even if F2 is used for a different feature and will also
  ignore the value of the F2_MENU counter.
+ Fix a crash that would occur decrypting a world with a
  password exactly 15 chars long.
+ The label for the INPUT STRING command should no longer be
  able to overflow outside of the window.
+ Fix a crash that would occur attempting to open the help file
  from the world decryption confirm dialog.
+ Fix bug where saved layer MZMs and board MZMs without robots
  would have useless extra data at the end of the file.
+ Scroll contents properly display game colors during gameplay.
+ An error message is now displayed for failed board exports.
+ Enabled writing zip data descriptors on the 3DS to decrease
  saving time.
- The "password protected" error message has been removed as it
  was redundant with the confirmation dialog following it.
- The "disassemble_extras" and "disassemble_base" options no
  longer affect Robotic output during gameplay. SAVE_ROBOT will
  always output extra words and base 10 numbers regardless of
  user configuration.

DEVELOPERS

+ Implemented a main event loop to replace the various separate
  event loops scattered around MegaZeux. See core.h and core.c
  for more info.
+ Refactored the following contexts to use the main loop:
  titlescreen, gameplay, main menu, game menu, editor, palette
  editor.
+ When enabled, the debug FPS display will now update from any
  interface using the main loop. If fullscreen mode is active,
  the FPS display will now appear in the top-left corner of the
  screen for any main loop interface aside from the editor.
+ The --disable-screenshots config.sh option can be used to
  disable screenshot support. This allows platforms that don't
  use render_layer.c to stop building and linking it.
+ Cleaned up m_show()/m_hide() overuse.
+ Replaced all uses of "bool" with "boolean" to avoid potential
  C/C++ compatibility issues.
- Removed most old/unused source code in contrib/unzip, src/old,
and src/vfs.

September 17th, 2018 - MZX 2.91f

A bugfix release focusing primarily on renderers, the 3DS and
Wii ports, and the Makefile build system. Highlights: the 3DS
port should perform better now, the Wii port's GX renderer has
been restored, the 'darwin' platform has more Unix-like options
now, and several crashes have been fixed.

USERS

+ The config setting 'audio_buffer' can also be specified with
  'audio_buffer_samples' now. The default value for this setting
  is now 1024 (instead of 4096).
+ Fixed a crash that could occur in the counter debugger.
+ Fixed a crash that occurs when attempting to add a watchpoint
  for robot local counters, loopcount, etc. Using these counters
  as watchpoints will watch the global robot's instances of
  these variables (for other robots, use e.g. r#.local1).
+ Using SMZX_INDICES or LOAD_ROBOT on an unset string no longer
  causes a crash.
+ png2smzx is now properly bundled with Linux builds.
+ Improved the performance of loading partial charsets for the
  glsl, opengl2, and 3DS renderers. Other renderers were not
  affected by this issue.
+ Fix opengl2 unbound sprite regression introduced in 2.91e.
+ The opengl2 renderer now correctly draws unbound sprites
  containing chars with a transparent foreground color.
+ 3DS renderer optimizations. (asie)
+ 3DS screen focusing now mimics the NDS port's behavior. (asie)
+ Fixed bug where games could fail to open files on some
  platforms if the paths contained duplicate slashes. (asie)
+ Added a Wii software layer renderer. This renderer can be
  selected with "video_output = xfb" in the config file.
+ Wii GX renderer optimizations.
+ Added layer rendering support to the GX renderer.
+ The Wii GX renderer now uses the gl_vsync config option to
  toggle vsync. For the Wii, this feature is on by default.
  Disabling it may increase the framerate of some games but may
  also cause other problems.
+ The loading bar on console platforms now redraws the screen
  less often.

DEVELOPERS

+ GAMESDIR/BINDIR/SHAREDIR now properly apply PREFIX when they
  are not explicitly set by config.sh.
+ LIBDIR is now user-definable like BINDIR et al. Variations
  such as "lib64" currently must be explicitly provided for
  platforms that still use them.
+ Remove src folder from CFLAGS to fix a bug where system
  includes could be mistaken for MegaZeux headers. All includes
  of MegaZeux headers must be done using relative paths now.
+ Fixed include bugs for X11 and Carbon clipboard handlers.
+ Makefile now attempts to respect the prefix when running
  sdl-config, sdl2-config, and libpng-config.
+ Renamed the "darwin" config.sh platform to "darwin-dist".
+ Added "darwin" and "darwin-devel" config.sh platforms. These
  act like Mac OS X versions of the "unix" and "unix-devel"
  options.
+ The darwin-dist build system and instructions are now somewhat
  more clear and robust.
+ Fixed a bug where zlib wouldn't necessarily be linked to
  png2smzx.
+ Renderers will now use render_layer to draw the text_video
  fallback if no render_graph function is present.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

September 3rd, 2018 - MZX 2.91e

Bugfix release fixing some crashes, port bugs, and some other
significant issues affecting a variety of things.

USERS

+ Fixed bug where loading a board charset would also clear all
  of the extended charsets.
+ Fixed bug where loading a default charset in the editor would
  also clear all of the extended charsets.
+ Loading a 2.91 world when a renderer with no layer support is
  active no longer triggers an error message.
+ Fixed a memory corruption bug in the non-SDL Wii port caused
  by faulty threading code.
+ Fixed crash that could occur when updating a board undo frame.
+ Fixed crash when changing to a board with overlay disabled in
  overlay editing mode.
+ Fixed a bug where the protected charset could get cleared for
  renderers without layer rendering support.
+ Enabled C99-compliant stdio functions for mingw, fixing at
  least one crash bug and possibly improving performance.
+ The NDS port now attempts to detect argv[0].
+ The 3DS port now attempts to detect argv[0] and otherwise will
  start in /3ds/megazeux instead of /.
+ The 3DS port .3dsx file is now located in /3ds/megazeux.
+ The MOVE PLAYER [dir] and MOVE PLAYER [dir] [label] commands
  now update the commands cycle and commands total values.
+ Fixed a bug where MZX and checkres wouldn't accept some
  DEFLATE-related ZIP flags.
+ checkres no longer crashes on failing to open a resource zip.
+ The window caption now updates correctly when using either of
  the overlay renderers.
+ Update checking will now display an error instead of silently
  hiding the updater when the updater fails to initialize.
+ Fixed an issue where UIs would execute redundant frames.
+ Fixed a bug where string comparison would not order strings of
  different lengths correctly. (GreaseMonkey)

DEVELOPERS

+ Code style has been cleaned up in numerous files.
+ Moved GLSL shaders from assets/shaders/ to assets/glsl/.
+ Added missing GPL headers to GLSL shaders and added slightly
  better documentation to them.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

July 12th, 2018 - MZX 2.91d

This is a minor bugfix release to get a handful of fixes out
primarily concerning the updater. The NDS/3DS/PSP/Wii ports now
include a copy of Caverns of Zeux.

USERS

+ Added timeouts to updater network operations.
+ Fixed bug where the updater would retry downloads without
  regard to the status code.
+ The updater is now force-disabled for all non-Windows
  platforms in config.sh.
+ Fixed bug where breakpoints could trigger on the wrong line.
+ Amended VOLUME/MOD FADE # # bounding to clamp values in port
  versions. DOS versions will still wrap between 0 and 255.
+ Added DOS compatibility fix for sprN_off.
+ Window caption is now properly updated when loading a world
  from an unedited world in the editor.
+ Fixed bug where ".." would change to the current directory if
  the current path ended in a path separator.
- Removed undocumented support for "title.cnf", "game.cnf", and
  "editor.cnf" config files, which would have been loaded from
  the same directory as the main config (not to be confused with
  world-specific config files, which are still supported).

DEVELOPERS

+ The MSYS2 buildscripts have been overhauled to work with the
  new devkitPro pacman repositories.
+ Added config options to select vorbis, tremor, tremor-lowmem,
  or to disable ogg vorbis file support. The 3DS and Wii ports
  now use tremor instead of tremor-lowmem.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

March 4th, 2018 - MZX 2.91c

This release contains an assortment of bugfixes ranging from
player clone fixes to obscure compatibility patches. A handful
of updater issues have been fixed (or at least addressed).

MegaZeux can now automatically check for updates on startup on
Windows platforms. This behavior can be configured, and by
default will simply leave a message in the window caption.

USERS

+ MegaZeux can now automatically run the updater on startup
  on applicable platforms. This can be configured with the
  'update_auto_check' config file option.
+ Fixed a bug where several .MOD variants stopped working with
  libxmp enabled.
+ Sound effects in subdirectories can now be used in the SFX
  editor.
+ Fixed a bug where checkres would fail on legacy worlds with
  very long custom SFX.
+ Checkres no longer ignores the SFX tables of 2.90+ worlds.
+ Fixed a bug where interpolated expressions containing ternary
  operators could terminate counter names early.
+ Fixed faulty IF ANY compatibility behavior.
+ Fixed a bug where FWRITE functions could change the case of
  user-defined filenames when creating new files on non-Windows
  platforms.
+ SMZX mode 1 palettes are now exported correctly as 16 colors
  instead of as 256 colors.
+ Fixed subtly inconsistent timing in certain built-ins.
+ Fixed bug where wind and transporters could clone the player.
+ MegaZeux now restarts correctly in paths containing spaces
  when the updater is run.
+ Subroutines in pre-port MZX worlds now always return to the
  command after the subroutine was sent.
+ Typed color components now wrap from the maximum value to zero
  like dialog number inputs, and pressing minus will now negate
  the input number.
+ Copying chars in the char editor between regular and SMZX
  screen modes now works properly.
+ Fixed a crash that could occur when placing things on a vlayer
  larger than the current board.
+ Sharks and SpittingTigers with firing rates greater than 4 now
  retain their firing rate when edited.
+ Fixed a bug where world decryption could crash. (Revvy)
+ If the glsl renderer is selected by default, the detection of
  a software opengl driver will result in falling back to
  software. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug in the GLSL renderer where an additional window is
  created if the OpenGL version is low enough to cause a
  fallback to software. (Lancer-X)

DEVELOPERS

+ Added .MZX-based unit testing system. Run with "make test".
  See testworlds/README.md for more information.
+ The default renderer is now auto_glsl, which turns into glsl
  if not using a blacklisted opengl driver. (Lancer-X)

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

January 6, 2018 - MZX 2.91b

Here's a fairly significant update for MegaZeux 2.91, fixing
several major Robotic, audio, and editor related bugs, as well
as issues that mostly affected Linux platforms. Also of note is
the updated MSVC and Xcode support by Spectere.

USERS

+ Added the config file option "editor_thing_menu_places". When
  set to 0, selecting an object from the thing menus (F3-F10)
  will place the object in the buffer but not on the board.
  Defaults to 1.
+ Fixed a bug where MZMs could sometimes fail to load in the
  editor.
+ MZMs loaded in the editor now behave correctly when undone.
+ Fixed bug where GOOP_WALK wouldn't always be 0 when loading
  old worlds.
+ Values of GOOP_WALK greater than 1 no longer cause issues.
+ Board time limits greater than 255 are no longer truncated
  when saving worlds/saves.
+ Fixed bug where "robot not found" errors could result from
  using backspace on robots in the editor.
+ Fixed backwards string inequality evaluation.
+ String inequality compares are now endian-safe.
+ Fixed a bug where certain mods (e.g. FR_TOWER.MOD, Neve.s3m)
  could repeat to the wrong order after reaching the end.
+ Fixed a bug where certain .it channels could partially ignore
  the volume command.
+ Setting mod_position in libxmp now works for positions in the
  middle of orders (NoSuck).

DEVELOPERS

+ Updated MSVC for Visual Studio 2017. (Spectere)
+ Added xcode support. (Spectere)
+ "make clean" now deletes ccv. (pgimeno)
+ Fixed creeping CRLF usage. (Lachesis, pgimeno, Spectere)
+ Fixed a bug where the MSYS2 build scripts could inadvertently
include non-portable SDL2 binaries in Windows builds.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

November 22, 2017 - MZX 2.91

This release introduces mostly new editor features, but also a
a few Robotic features to note. It also fixes over 30 bugs.

MegaZeux now features a palette editor for SMZX modes 2 and 3,
and worlds can be saved and loaded in SMZX mode. The char editor
has been changed to allow preview palettes (mostly to aid with
SMZX editing), and can now access the extended character sets.
The new vlayer editor allows the vlayer to be edited directly.

On the Robotic side of things, LOAD_COUNTERS actually works now,
SMZX mode 3 indices can be loaded from a file, the message line
can be configured to use normal MZX mode in SMZX modes, and new
string features such as simple wildcard matching and negative
offsets have been added. String support has been improved to
disallow invalid or nonsense string splices that previously had
undefined behavior.

Additionally, asie's new Nintendo 3DS port has been merged into
MZX, and optional SDL support has been added for the Wii.

FEATURES

+ Added SMZX_INDICES special counter to load SMZX indices. This
  counter works with either a filename or a string, e.g.
  set "file.palidx" "SMZX_INDICES", and will do nothing outside
  of mode 3.
+ Added MOD_LENGTH counter. The value of this counter is length
  of the current playing music in rows for modules, or in
  samples for PCM audio.
+ Added MAX_SAMPLES counter. When set, MegaZeux will limit the
  maximum number of samples that will play simultaneously. Set
  to -1 to disable the sample limit.
+ Added 'max_simultaneous_samples' config file option. This
  behaves the same as the MAX_SAMPLES counter, but applies
  globally.
+ Added SMZX_MESSAGE counter. When set to 0 with SMZX active,
  messages will display in normal MZX mode instead of SMZX
  using the first 16 colors of the SMZX palette.
+ Added 'random_seed#' counters to read and write the random
  seed, 32 bits at a time (random_seed0 controls the low 32 bits
  and random_seed1 controls the high 32 bits. (Lancer-X)
+ Added a case-sensitive string equality operator:
  IF "$string" === "ABC" then "label".
+ Added wildcard-matching string equality operators:
  IF "$string" ?= "a?%" then "label"
  IF "$string" ?== "a?%" then "label" (case-sensitive).
  The character '?' will match exactly one of any character in
  $string, and '%' will match any number of any character in
  $string (including no characters).
+ Added negative indexing for strings, e.g. SET "$string.-X" 32.
  This manipulates the string at the Xth character starting from
  the end of the string (with -1 for the final character).
+ Added negative offsets for strings, e.g. SET "$string+-X" "a".
+ Added multiple character indexing for strings. When a length
  is provided with a string index, e.g. SET "$string.X#Y" 12345,
  the characters at positions X, X+1, ..., X+Y-1 will be treated
  as a single 8*Y bit number. This works for values of Y between
  1 and 4, with 4 characters providing the same functionality as
  a counter.
+ The palette editor and character editor are now accessible
  while testing. Press Alt+E or Alt+C respectively to access
  them from the counter debugger.
+ Extended the palette editor to SMZX modes 2 and 3. The updated
  palette editor allows the editing of all 256 SMZX mode 2/3
  colors and editing color indices for SMZX 3.
+ Component numbers can now be typed in the palette editor by
  clicking the component name or its number, e.g. clicking "Red"
  allows you to type a red value.
+ SMZX indices can now be imported/exported while editing in
  mode 3 using import/export palette.
+ Added a new vlayer editor. In the world editor, press Alt+V to
  switch to the vlayer editor. The vlayer is something like an
  invisible global overlay that can be used to store and
  retrieve graphical data through Robotic. See the editor help
  and the Robotic reference manual for more details.
+ Added color selection to the character editor. Press C to
  choose a color to preview and edit chars with, and press Alt+C
  to revert back to the default grey.
+ Added extended charset support to the char editor. Extended
  charsets can be selected during char selection. Note that in
  gameplay these chars can be accessed only by unbound sprites.
+ Selected blocks of chars with a height greater than one
  (before selecting a subdivision) are now properly supported.
  Using -/+ with these selections will move in a tiled manner,
  with no overlap between chars in "tiles". Charsets can also be
  exported/imported using this tiling behavior.
+ The -/+ keys now behave the same in the char selection screen
  as they do in the char editor.
+ The character editor help now covers several shortcuts that
  were previously missing (Alt+B, Shift+Arrows, etc...).
+ The undo/redo shortcuts in the character editor are now Ctrl+Z
  for undo and Ctrl+Y for redo.
+ Added undo/redo functionality to the world editor. Use Ctrl+Z
  to undo changes to the board/overlay/vlayer and Ctrl+Y to
  redo.
+ The default editor undo history stack size has been extended
  to 100 levels.
+ The editor will now prompt the user to create a new starting
  board when opened. If a new board is created, the global first
  board will be set to the new board and the title board will be
  renamed.
+ Saved positions now have confirmation dialogs. Saved positions
  are saved to/loaded from the editor.cnf file for each world.
+ Pressing Enter/Return on the overlay (and vlayer) now acts the
  same as on the board, changing both the buffer and the current
  layer being edited.
+ Pressing P on the overlay (and vlayer) now acts the same as on
  the board, changing the character in the buffer but NOT on the
  current layer. This is equivalent to the original overlay
  behavior for Enter.
+ Block tiling movement (Ctrl+Arrows) now works with most block
  actions, and does not require an initial block placement to
  activate.
+ Restoring its DOS functionality, Alt+D now toggles the default
  colors of built-in types in the editor. When disabled,
  built-ins placed from thing menus will use the buffer color
  instead of their default colors, and a red dot will appear on
  the right side of the status bar.
+ Color selection now supports typing in the hex value of a
  color/subpalette to select the given color/subpalette. For
  example, typing "4c" will select background color 4 and
  foreground color 12.
+ Readded the downver utility.
- Removed the undocumented Shift+F7 shortcut in the editor. This
  shortcut was redundant with F11.

FIXES

+ Fixed a bug that would cause Linux binaries to fail to find
  most resources.
+ Fixed a bug where loading a save from the titlescreen, exiting
  gameplay to a world that doesn't exist, and then loading a
  second save would corrupt the counter and string hash tables.
+ Fixed crash that would occur when loading a saved position on
  the same board referring to out-of-bounds coordinates.
+ Fixed a freeze that could occur opening the counter debugger
  to an empty list or searching for a counter in an empty list.
+ LOAD_COUNTERS now works as intended.
+ Fixed a bug where key repeat would be prematurely terminated
  when releasing a key while holding another key.
+ Attempting to open the robot validator with no errors will no
  longer crash MegaZeux.
+ Backspace now mirrors delete in overlay mode instead of
  affecting the board.
+ Moving an overlay block partially out of bounds in the editor
  will now correctly clear the block's original position.
+ The color selector will now correctly display SMZX palettes in
  SMZX mode instead of the default char 254.
+ Fixed bug where the mouse cursor would vanish after using the
  robot debugger configuration dialog in the editor.
+ Fixed a bug where the counter debugger could sometimes display
  behind the robot debugger after exiting the counter debugger.
+ Undo in the char editor now works correctly with the mouse.
+ The char editor no longer forces the screen to SMZX mode 1
  when editing in SMZX modes 2 or 3.
+ Fixed screen corruption bug when resizing the char editor in
  SMZX modes.
+ Fixed a bug where multichar editing wouldn't correctly wrap to
  the start of the charset.
+ The editing area outside of the current board is now correctly
  drawn when SMZX is enabled.
+ The viewport is now correctly drawn when SMZX is enabled and
  the UI or unbound sprites are active.
+ The editor bar no longer appears while SMZX is enabled in view
  mode.
+ Messages are now drawn correctly in SMZX mode.
+ Fixed bug where centering the viewport could change the width
  and height of the viewport.
+ Unbound sprites are now clipped correctly against the viewport
  when the viewport origin is not 0,0. (Lancer-X)
+ The VLAYER_SIZE counter now clears new vlayer area added when
  it is increased. This applies only to 2.91+ worlds.
+ The VLAYER_WIDTH and VLAYER_HEIGHT counters now preserve data
  on the vlayer when set. This applies only to 2.91+ worlds.
+ Fixed several bugs with string length and offset parsing that
  would allow invalid string accesses to work in certain cases.
+ COPY BLOCK $string now works correctly with string splices.
+ Fixed a bug where saving and loading 2.90X files wouldn't work
  on the Nintendo DS.
+ Fixed a bug where mouse clicks would carry through from the UI
  into games.
+ Invalid gl_scaling_shader values should no longer appear as
  the current loaded scaler.
+ MegaZeux now falls back to the default scaling shader when a
  selected scaling shader fails to compile.
+ Blank sprite chars are now drawn when ccheck is 3. (Lancer-X)
+ The sprite color is used with ccheck 3 collisions. (Lancer-X)
+ When spr_yorder is enabled, sprites with the same (sprN_y +
  sprN_cy) value are now consistently ordered by their sprite
  numbers.
+ The collision rectangles of ccheck 3 sprites now constrained
  to the sprite dimensions (Lancer-X).
+ MZX no longer crashes when a line of length 512 characters or
  longer is pasted into the robot editor.
+ Fixed a crash bug when trying to swap a sprite with an
  invalid sprite index.

DEVELOPERS

+ Added Nintendo 3DS port. (asiekierka)
+ Added "make uninstall" option to the Linux makefile.
+ Added devkitPro portlibs paths to the NDS and Wii Makefiles.
- Removed the depackers and non-MegaZeux formats from libxmp.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

September 4, 2017 - MZX 2.90d

Here's another bugfix release. This is mostly assorted small
fixes, but there are also a couple of major fixes here: first,
the ternary operator now works correctly when nested both with
and without expressions, and second, sprN_setview does not break
in conjunction with certain unbound sprites. Additionally, SAMs
will not be converted to WAV files anymore (and are now natively
supported) and the robot debugger config is accessible from the
editor.

FEATURES

+ The current MegaZeux version is now visible from the enter
  menu on the title screen. This is to assist identifying the
  version on platforms that don't respect window title changes
  or have no window border.
+ Updated checkres.bat and checkres documentation.
+ The robot debugger configuration screen is now accessible from
  the editor via Alt+F11.
+ Removed SAM to WAV converter. MegaZeux now has native SAM
  support. (asiekierka)
+ Added crt-wave.frag, updated crt.frag. (astral)

FIXES

+ Fixed a bug where MegaZeux would crash when editing a robot
  with an invalid IF command operator.
+ Fixed a bug where the ternary operator would fail to find the
  correct colon when the middle term contained a second ternary
  operator in a nested expression.
+ Nested ternary operators should now behave as expected.
+ Fixed a bug where the built-in cursor would disappear after
  exiting testing with EXIT_GAME.
+ Fixed a bug where the listening mod would not restart after
  exiting testing.
+ Fixed a bug where the robot debugger would not wrap long lines
  of Robotic code correctly.
+ Attempting to save a world in a write-protected location
  correctly displays an error message again.
+ Fixed a bug where key repeat would not work when scrolling
  through the counter debugger tree list.
+ checkres will no longer report empty filenames as dependencies
  e.g. SET "" TO "FWRITE_OPEN".
+ The -q flag in checkres will now correctly output filenames
  instead of nothing.
+ Fixed a bug where sprN_setview would scroll the viewport to
  the wrong side of the screen if the sprite is unbound and is
  close to the top or left edge of the board. (Lancer-X)

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed PSP and NDS ports. (asiekierka)

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

July 25, 2017 - MZX 2.90c

This is a small fix release mostly cleaning up issues from the
previous release.

Notable fixes include a crash on certain instances of string
interpolation into counters/labels/text. Playing mods as sound
effects works again, and the audio_sample_rate config file
option now works correctly.

This release also includes support for loading save files from
MegaZeux 2.84X and experimental editor behavior for handling
board charsets and palettes.

FEATURES

+ Save files from 2.84X worlds can now be loaded.
+ The editor can be configured to automatically load board
  charsets and palettes now. Use the 'editor_load_board_assets'
  config file option to enable this behavior. This behavior is
  disabled by default. Note that this will OVERWRITE THE CURRENT
  WORLD CHARSET AND PALETTE and your changes will NOT be saved
  automatically.
+ GLSL is now the default renderer. (Lancer-X)

FIXES

+ Fixed bug where --disable-modular builds would fail to link.
+ Fixed bug with libxmp integration where mods could not be
  played as sound effects.
+ Fixed bug with libxmp integration where MZX would assume
  audio_sample_rate was 44100, causing mods to play at incorrect
  pitches with other rates.
+ Fixed bug where editor config file options would be ignored at
  the command line.
+ Fixed bug where string interpolation into a label/counter name
could cause MZX to crash with very long strings.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

July 16, 2017 - MZX 2.90b

It's been two weeks, so here's a bugfix release for MZX 2.90.
There isn't a whole lot that's new to talk about.

Firstly, the palette editor has gone through an overhaul. This
is mostly internal preparation for an eventual SMZX palette
editor, but the new features include the partial restoration of
mouse input (which was removed in 2.80X), the addition of color
sliders, the ability to hide the palette editor help, and two
new colorspaces (HSL and CIELAB) to aid in the selection of
palette colors.

Next, the robot debugger introduced in 2.90 has new features.
You can now set "watchpoints" to watch the status of particular
variables, and you can send labels/goto from the robot debugger.
The robot debugger config screen has been visually improved, and
line number breakpoints can be defined. Another notable feature
is that KEY_PRESSED and KEY_CODE values are now displayed in the
debug window during gameplay.

libxmp is now the default sound engine for modules, fixing a
longstanding bug where certain S3Ms would have muted channels.
GDM modules are now supported by MZX again. If you notice any
inaccuracies with mod files, please report them to the tracker.

Fixed bugs include a major overhaul of the glsl shaders for
compatibility with almost any system, various sprite, text box,
and input bugs, a crash fix when MZMs were saved from out of
bounds board locations, and a bug where opening worlds or
testing from the editor could cause MegaZeux to exit.

FEATURES

+ The "shaders/extra" folder is now "shaders/scalers". The
  default vertex shader is still located in the shaders folder.
+ The default scaling shader can now be set in the config file
  using the gl_scaling_shader option. If not defined, MegaZeux
  will load assets/shaders/scalers/semisoft.frag.
+ The robot debugger now supports monitoring the values of
  counters and strings. Use the config menu/breakpoint editor to
  add watchpoints; when the debugger detects a change in a
  watchpoint counter/string AFTER a command has been executed,
  the robot debugger will open.
+ The robot debugger can now send robots labels. Use 'G' or
  select 'Goto' in the robot debugger to use this feature. The
  name and label inputs support expression parsing and string/
  counter interpolation.
+ The robot debugger can now use line numbers in breakpoints.
+ The palette editor help can now be hidden with Alt+H. The
  default behavior for this can be set in the config file. The
  palette editor help is visible by default.
+ The palette editor's mouse functionality has been improved.
  Behavior when clicking the palette has been restored, and
  component sliders have been added.
+ The palette editor now supports alternate color spaces.
+ The debug window now displays the last key_code (green) and
  key_pressed (magenta) values detected during gameplay. These
  values are located in the bottom right corner of the window.
+ The default fullscreen resolution for scalable renderers is
  now 1280,720. The default fullscreen resolution for 'software'
  is still 640,480. The default aspect ratio is now 'modern'.
+ The checkres utility has been updated to support 2.90X worlds,
  worlds in subdirectories of zip archives, multiple input files
  to test, and the ability to specify secondary directories and
  zips to search (e.g. for games with separate music zips).

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed a bug where certain "keyN" labels, such as "key$", would
  not work correctly.
+ Integer comparisons between numbers greater than 2^31-1 apart
  now work correctly. (Lancer-X)
+ The palette editor now displays the SMZX mode 1 palette
  correctly.
+ Sprite collisions now correctly ignore the sprite's visual
  width and height.
+ Blank lines are no longer skipped when copy-pasting text into
  the robot editor. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where key presses in dialogs could be detected in
  games, and keypresses could still carry between other dialogs.
+ [ message boxes now use the same screen mode as everything
  else. Same with scrolls. (Lancer-X)
+ spr#_setview now works with unbound sprites. It's pretty nasty
  as the viewport can't scroll with pixel precision, but the new
  behavior should still be better than the old. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug affecting certain Intel HD Graphics cards and the
  GLSL renderer that appears to have been around since that
  renderer was first introduced. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where the numeric numpad keys were inappropriately
  translated to regular keys based on numlock when they were
  read from KEY_PRESSED. This behavior is now locked to worlds
  from 2.82X through 2.84X.
+ Fixed a bug where warping the mouse on one axis would snap the
  mouse to the nearest pixel on the other axis, causing problems
  for upscaled windows.
+ Fixed a bug where mouse control would not respect video_ratio
  settings aside from "stretch".
* Fixed a bug where MZX would attempt to load certain invalid
  worlds that should have been caught by validation.
+ Copy block to MZM no longer crashes when the MZM is partially
  overlapping the board edge. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed bug where MegaZeux would sometimes exit immediately on
  loading a game or would immediately exit testing.

DEVELOPERS

+ libxmp is now the default module sound engine. Use "make xmp"
  to make and install libxmp if it is not available on your
  platform.
+ Mac OS X portability improved. (Spectere and Why-Fi)

June 29, 2017 - MZX 2.90

Hey, it's been a while! Didn't mean to keep everyone waiting.
To make up for it as much as possible, we've prepared an extra
special release of MegaZeux here for you. Yeah, you!

I don't even know where to start with this release, as there's
simply a lot to talk about. MZX's world formats and rendering
architecture have gone through major overhauls, and a multitude
of bugs have been fixed (60+). Particularly the MZX UI graphical
glitch that occurred when an SMZX mode was enabled.

Some notable new features are unbound sprites (MZX's new native
pixel precision support), loading character sets/palettes/source
code/MZMs from strings, saving MZMs to strings, a new Robotic
debugger, the SAVE_COUNTERS and LOAD_COUNTERS function counters,
options to help create standalone game releases, the ability to
assign character sets/palettes to a board to load on entry, and
resetting boards on entry. The size limit of Robotic bytecode
has been increased to 2MB.

Other important mentions: MegaZeux has been updated to use
SDL 2.0 and libmodplug 0.8.9.0. The SAVE_WORLD function counter
has been permanently removed. The downver utility has been
temporarily discontinued, as adapting it to this release would
have been a considerable amount of work. Instead, there is a new
option in the Export menu in the editor to export a 2.84 world.

Enjoy, and try not to get overwhelmed by all of the new stuff!

FEATURES

+ Added a built-in robot debugger. See the Debug Mode section of
  the help file for details.
+ Added the COMMANDS_STOP special counter to MegaZeux. When a
  robot executes a number of commands exceeding this value while
  testing, the robot debugger will be enabled automatically and
  will open. During regular gameplay, it will be ignored. The
  default value of COMMANDS_STOP is 2000000.
+ The counter debugger now remembers its previous position after
  being reopened.
+ Added commands_cycle and commands_total variables to the Robot
  section of the counter debugger. See the Debug Mode section of
  the help file for details.
+ Certain types specified as 255 on the char ID table are now
  treated as Custom* types when placed and selected in the
  editor. If you switched a type to char ID 255 in a game that
  already had that type, the parameters will not be changed
  (and the types will still be char 0 if they were already
  placed in the world). When making a type a Custom* type from
  the global chars dialog, it will appear visually different in
  the list and in the character selection window, and also ask
  for confirmation.
+ The enter menu can be closed with escape now.
+ In the editor, the Backspace key now removes the top layer
  and brings the under layer to the top, as a compliment to Del.
  This does not affect the text entry behavior.
+ Seeking in the String section of the counter debugger will now
  ignore the $ prefix.
+ Tentative joypad POV hat support added: joyNhat = U, D, L, R
+ The BUTTONS counter has been extended to support the mouse
  wheel and X1/X2 buttons.
+ Strings can now be used in the LOAD PALETTE "file" command in
  place of a file name, i.e. LOAD PALETTE "$string+10".
+ Strings can now be used in the LOAD CHAR SET "file" command in
  place of a file name, i.e. LOAD CHAR SET "@240$chars".
+ Strings can now be used for the special counter LOAD_ROBOT in
  place of a file name, i.e. set "$str" "LOAD_ROBOT".
+ Strings can now be used for saving and loading MZMs in place
  of a file name, i.e. put "str" image_file... (Lancer-X)
+ Added ESCAPE_MENU counter. When set to 0, this counter will
  prevent pressing escape from opening the exit gameplay menu.
  This will not affect any other escape menus in MZX, and the
  exit gameplay menu can still be opened by other means, such as
  ALT+F4, CTRL+C, the window close button, etc.
+ Added EXIT_GAME function counter. When set to anything but 0,
  this will cause MegaZeux to exit to the title screen. This has
  no effect on the title screen.
+ Added the ternary operator (?:) to expressions. If the value
  to the left of ? is not equal to zero, the expression between
  the ? and the : will be evaluated. If the value to the left of
  ? is equal to zero, the expression to the right of : will be
  evaluated.
+ Added SAVE_COUNTERS and LOAD_COUNTERS special counters. These
  will save and load files containing every counter and string
  from the world they're used in, respectively. These files are
  not version checked, and may be used like save files.
+ Robots now keep their robot IDs after reloading saves.
+ Added standalone mode. The config parameters standalone_mode
  and no_titlescreen can now be used (from MZXRun only) to
  create standalone versions of MZX with the ability to fully
  customise the player's experience. See config.txt for details.
  (Lancer-X)
+ The minimal help bar now displays robot memory and the current
  board mod when contextually appropriate.
+ The minimal help options for the board and robot editors are
  now enabled by default.
+ Shaders can now be changed from the F2 menu when using the
  GLSL renderer. The user can select a fragment shader from the
  assets/shaders/extra/ directory. If a matching vertex shader
  exists, it will be loaded alongside the fragment shader.
  Otherwise, MZX will fall back to the default vertex shader.
+ On Linux and Mac OS X the configuration file will be copied
  into the user's home directory and given the name
  .megazeux-config if it is not already present. This config
  file will then be used instead of the global one. (Lancer-X)
+ Added unbound sprites. Sprites can be unbound from the grid by
  setting spr#_unbound to 1. Their coordinates will now refer to
  the sprite's location in pixels, not tiles. spr#_width,
  height, refx and refy still refer to chars; however, spr#_x,
  y, cx, cy, cwidth and cheight are all in pixels. Unbound
  sprites do not work with all renderers; currently, out of the
  renderers available on the PC platforms, the overlay2 renderer
  lacks this functionality. (Lancer-X)
+ Unbound sprites do not let char 32 or blank characters (when
  in ccheck 2) through like regular sprites do. Instead, set
  spr#_tcol to a color that will be transparent when the unbound
  sprite is drawn. (Lancer-X)
+ Unbound sprites can make use of additional hidden charsets.
  There are an additional 14 charsets beyond the default that
  can be modified through using load char set or char edit.
  (e.g. load char set "@256charset.chr")
  A sprite can be set to refer to these later chars with the
  spr#_offset counter. The offset value is then added to each
  char in the sprite. You can use this to refer to higher char
  sets.
  (e.g. set "spr0_offset" 256)
  Offset values can also be set to locations within a char set.
  (Lancer-X)
+ To allow you to access the extended charsets, the option to
  load char set now takes up to 4 digits, rather than merely 3.
  The + option still only allows 2 hex digits. (Lancer-X)
+ The colors used by tiles of a given color # in SMZX mode 3
  can now be rebound using the "smzx_idx#,#" counters.
  (e.g. set "smzx_idx7,0" 32)
  Now if you put down a c07 tile, all 00 pixels will refer to
  color 32 (as opposed to color 0 in SMZX mode 2 or color 7 in
  SMZX mode 1). These values are reset whenever the SMZX mode is
  changed. Once again, this is only available to renderers that
  support unbound sprites. (Lancer-X)
+ Edited worlds now retain their world version until resaved.
  Before, they would lose their world version after testing.
+ Added world version display to the debug window.
+ Added GOOP_WALK counter for robots.
+ Added "Reset board on entry" parameter for boards. When set,
  the board will reset to its original state when the board is
  entered during gameplay. This setting can be saved as a board
  default.
+ Added "Load charset on entry" parameter for boards. When set,
  MegaZeux will load the selected charset file when the board
  is entered during gameplay. This setting can be saved as a
  board default.
+ Added "Load palette on entry" parameter for boards. When set,
  MegaZeux will load the selected palette file when the board
  is entered during gameplay. This setting can be saved as a
  board default.
+ Maximum robot size has been increased from 64kb to 2mb.
  (Lancer-X)

+ Debytecode: the LOAD_SOURCE_FILE special counter can now be
  used to load and compile a robot program from source code.
  This can be used with either a file or a string as input.
+ Debytecode: the robot editor's import robot menu now supports
  loading legacy source code.

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed crash bug when using ALT+Z (Clear Board).
+ Fixed crash bug when attempting to view the help file in the
  updater.
+ Fixed crash bug when attempting to use SMZX_R/G/B with out-of-
  range indexes.
+ Fixed crash on exit when the config file did not explicitly
  specify update hosts.
+ Fixed memory leak involving bounds-breaking FREADn calls.
+ Fixed counter debugger issue where counters and strings
  starting with chars over 'Z' would cause everything in their
  section to be placed into the '#' list.
+ Dialog window labels can not be put into focus by clicking
  them with the mouse anymore.
+ Dialog windows closed by pressing escape will now close only
  on a new press instead of whenever the key is held.
+ Load (F4)/quickload (F10) on invalid save files in-game leaves
  the current game running instead of exiting to the titlescreen
  or editor.
+ Fixed issue where counter debugger would display wrong values
  for the robot LOCAL counters.
+ Fixed robot editor issue where global robot coords would be
  reloaded as 65535.
+ Fixed issue where board defaults would be reset after leaving
  testing until the world was manually reloaded.
+ Fixed issue where the Board Info dialog would not close when
  'Cancel' was selected.
+ Fixed bug where chars 254 and 255 would not be reverted back
  to their defaults via F4/F5.
+ Fixed bug where player would move onto goop when walking into
  enemys on top of goop.
+ Fixed bug where 'enter' would be detected in loaded save files
  when loading from a title screen.
+ Fixed issue where MZX was using the world file version instead
  of the internal MZX version when saving MZMs and determining
  whether it could load MZMs both within the editor and in game.
+ Changed the caption behavior in the world editor as to refresh
  only when board values are synchronized.
+ Fixed bug where, when exiting gameplay, the world would keep
  running on the title screen if MegaZeux lost read access to
  the world file.
+ Fixed minor bug where trying to load a nonexistant mod would
  change MOD_NAME's output while the previous mod still played.
+ Fixed a Windows-only bug, where attempting to load a Robotic
  file in the Robot Editor or with LOAD_ROBOT would not load the
  entire file if the file contained 0x1A (char 26).
+ Fixed a bug where the lazer animation would fail to complete.
+ Fixed bug where the VOLUME # and MOD FADE # # inputs could go
  out of range, resulting in ear-piercing white noise. Inputs
  now wrap between 0 and 255 for compatibility reasons.
+ Fixed bug where certain unicode values could crash MZX in the
  character selection dialog.
+ Fixed bug where : "keyN" would not work on the Pandora.
+ Fixed a bug where FREAD could create a string larger than the
  maximum string size.
+ In the sprite section of the counter debugger, the spr_clistN
  values were incorrectly labelled as "spr_collisionN". Fixed.
+ Fixed counter debugger crash when selecting certain strings
  containing escaped values.
+ Added compatibility for the cycle-ending SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE,
  SHOOTSEEKER, and SPITFIRE commands from MegaZeux 2.83.
+ Fixed crash bug when attempting to use file counters with
  paths equal to or longer than 512 chars in length. MegaZeux

+ Fixed bug where MZX would crash with out-of-bounds joystick
  key mappings.
+ Fixed a bug where robots could not push the SliderNS type to
  the south.
+ Fixed a bug where a robot using #return or #top multiple times
  within a single command could cause a crash.
+ Fixed a port regression where IF ANY would continue to iterate
  over the board after finding a match, potentially triggering
  multiple subroutines, #return, or #top labels.
+ Fixed a bug where MZM error messages could repeat indefinitely
  and lock up MZX.
+ Fixed a bug where the (#)PUSHED label would not be sent to the
  first object in a row of pushed objects if that object was a
  robot.
+ Fixed support for PPC Linux builds. (Insidious)
+ Fixed a bug where a robot sent a subroutine would restart the
  command it was executing upon #return if the command was a
  multi-cycle command. This fix applies to worlds saved in 2.90
  and later only.
+ Fixed a bug where ALT+F4 would cause menus to open instead of/
  in addition to triggering an exit event.
+ Fixed a bug where subdirectory mods with different types of
  slashes in their names would fail to be recognized as the same
  mod.
+ Fixed a bug where SMZX palette intensities were not saved.
+ Made the opengl2 and glsl renderers endian-correct. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where keystrokes were getting lost during event
  processing. (Lancer-X)
+ The UI now uses the regular MZX mode and the protected palette
  when playing SMZX games. This is only available to renderers
  that support unbound sprites. (Lancer-X)
+ Changing from SMZX mode 1 to 0 correctly restores the palette.
  (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where the tree list in the counter debugger would
  rapidly scroll through elements when clicked.
+ Fixed a bug where the updater, on failing to receive data from
  the server, would consume large amounts of CPU before timing
  out. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed various bugs related to the pushing of sensors.
  (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where MZX would crash in some cases when testing
  after adding/importing new boards into a world.
+ Made KEY a board counter <=2.70. Also added masking <=2.62 to
  make Oath Demo work again. (Lancer-X)
+ Bullet types shot by robots clamped to 0-2. (Lancer-X)
+ SAVE_GAME and SAVE_WORLD now happen at the end of a cycle, not
  immediately. (Lancer-X)
+ SAVE_WORLD no longer exists. (Lancer-X)
+ Labels at the end of a program no longer get randomly sorted
  first and stop the actual first instance of that label being
  called. This fixes a bug in the Dark Corner 'Zane' demo.
  (Lancer-X)
+ Copy and copy block in pre-port MZX games now preserves the
  state of any robots copied. (Lancer-X)
+ Copying and pasting robot code with LF line endings on Windows
  now works. (Lancer-X)
+ MegaZeux can now be exited during an infinite loop. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where SAVE_GAME on the first cycle of a board
  would cause the game to be faded out on load. This still
  affects legacy worlds. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where trying to create new counters called "fread"
  or "fread_counter" in the counter debugger would cause the
  file being read to advance.
+ Fixed a bug where the numpad was unable to be used to control
  the player, despite being identical to the cursor keys for
  every other situation. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where pre-port worlds could play any number of
  concurrent samples. This makes portions of Bernard the Bard
  quite cacophonous. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where per-game config files could set options they
  weren't supposed to be able to.

DEVELOPERS

+ Fixed linking bug when attempting to make a modular build of
  MegaZeux in Debian/armhf. -fPIC is now enabled for modular
  builds on all platforms. (Insidious, ajs)
+ Added SDL 2.0 support. At the moment, the overlay renderers
  are not accelerated by SDL 2.0 and may be slower than their
  SDL 1.2 counterparts. Other minor inconsistencies may exist
  between the two versions. (ajs)
+ Keycode help diagram replaced with an HTML file (from the
  older PNG file). This will make future updates much easier.
+ Updated NDS, Wii and PSP ports to latest devkitpro toolchains.
+ Updated libmodplug to version 0.8.9.0. (asiekierka)
+ Added experimental libxmp support. (asiekierka)
+ Added experimental libopenmpt support. (asiekierka)
+ New rendering architecture that mostly sits alongside the old
  rendering architecture. There is a new function implemented by
  supporting renderers: render_layer(). This provides a layer
  in a similar form to the text_video array in graphics and
  expects that to be drawn on the screen. This is called once
  for each layer that is drawn- this means the board, overlay,
  UI and sprites. Each layer can have a different SMZX mode,
  although at the moment this is only used to allow the UI to
  remain in regular MZX mode while the game or editor is in SMZX
  mode. The render_layer() function is only called if it is
  implemented by the renderer and if there is something on the
  screen that can only be drawn by the renderer (e.g. unbound
  sprites, or UI elements in an SMZX game) (Lancer-X)
+ LibSDL2 support is now the default. It can still be disabled
  by passing --disable-libsdl2 to config.sh. (Lancer-X)

December 24, 2012 - MZX 2.84c

Hey all, new version of MegaZeux here! And hopefully without any
crashes this time around!  Haha yeah right.

The most notable thing this release (besides fixed crash bugs,
as usual) is the new counter debugger! Give it a try and tell us
what you think!

Counter binary search has been replaced with a hash table in
versions of MegaZeux for most platforms. This has resulted in
slightly faster counter lookups, and MUCH faster creation of
counters, since MegaZeux doesn't have to keep the list ordered.
The hash table is turned off for NDS builds for now due to tight
memory constraints.

Otherwise, most of the new features are editor enhancements and
modifications. Notable mentions are reordering the board list
with 'M' and a custom undo history size.

FEATURES

+ The functionality of the F11 counter/string debugger has been
  expanded to include sprites, robots, and miscellaneous world
  and board variables. The ability to modify many of these vars
  is limited and a large portion are read-only. In addition, you
  may add new counters and strings, hide empty counters/strings
  (does not affect built-in variables), and search by name and
  contents. Export is still limited to counters and strings.
+ Max string length has been increased from 1MiB (1048576 bytes)
  to 4MiB (4194304 bytes).
+ Board mods may now be selected from subdirectories of the game
  folder in the ALT+N dialog.
+ The title bar now displays the world and editing board/robot
  names based on context.
+ Fire Burns Space and Fire Burns Forever are off by default.
+ You may now specify the size of the undo history in the char
  editor, and the history affects the entire char set. Undo is
  still ALT+U, redo is now ALT+R.
+ You may now use the -/+ keys in the world editor to move to
  the previous/next boards in the board list, and Shift+Arrows
  to change to the boards linked by board edge.
+ You may now move the current board anywhere in the board list
  with M. You may not move the title screen board.
+ View mode in the board editor (V) will start from the current
  location of the screen now rather than at the top-left corner.
+ Config file options for default board settings added, as well
  as the ability to save these per-world from the editor.
+ Ctrl+G - Goto board position at X,Y.
+ png2smzx now requires less arguments and has an option to skip
  a char (generally char 32 will be useful to skip).

+ Debytecode: The robotic editor now asks for a confirmation to
  save the program on exit.

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed a bug in the 'glsl' renderer that caused the cursor
  color to be ignored (always white). This caused the cursor to
  not be visible if shown on a white background. (ajs)
+ Setting $string.length will not cause memory corruption now.
  In addition, its pre-2.84 behavior of intentionally allocating
  the string past the set length has been restored, but the
  length itself will still be set to the correct value.
+ Added bounds check to INC "$string" "value". Attempts to
  increase a string past its maximum length (4 MiB, or 4194304
  bytes) will now fail.
+ Fixed MegaZeux crash that could sometimes occur when a string
  was increased by itself.
+ Fixed MegaZeux crash that could occur when exiting the editor
  to a world file that failed validation.
+ Rolled string->storage_space into string->name to prevent
  buffer overflow errors and crashes. (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed crash that would occur when attempting to type in a dir
  in the ALT+N dialog.
+ Fixed a bug where copy block $string would apply REL twice.
+ Thanatos Insignia (DoZ Q1 2011, 98485) will now play without
  freezing both normally AND after loading a save. Robots will
  not be incorrectly versioned with the save format magic now.
+ Fixed bug where ALT+M wouldn't always edit non-stored types.
+ Fixed bug where ! could not be used as a substitute for 
+ Fixed a bug where tab-draw and block actions would carry
  between board and overlay editing. ALT+O now sets the drawing
  mode back to normal on a switch.
+ ALT+M now edits the overlay instead of the board while editing
  the overlay.
+ Quick-load (F10 during gameplay) will not work if the load
  menu (F4) has been disabled with the LOAD_MENU counter.
+ Fixed a bug where the listening mod directory would stay the
  same as the directory the editor was opened in.
+ The listening mod now continues to play after world and board
  changes, and also after the board mod has been changed by
  ALT+N or Shift+8/*.
+ LOAD_GAME will not incorrectly trigger JUSTENTERED anymore.
+ Palette/intensity changes made on the same cycle as a teleport
  player command are now properly taken into account. This fixes
  a game-stopping regression in Sponkgo's Legendary Journey
  where leaving the second stage's bonus area would leave the
  color intensity at 0.
+ SMZX mode is now disabled when leaving the editor if it was
  enabled in the editor via F11.
+ Fixed potential crash bug where robot bytecode files were not
  being validated before being loaded with LOAD_BC.
+ Fixed minor message box bug dating back to DOS where a message
  box starting with an unavailable option would begin with the
  cursor on a blank line.
+ Fixed crash that happened when typing over bounds while
  renaming a file in a file manager dialog. File and directory
  renaming now use a popup dialog akin to ALT+N.
+ Files with names longer than 55 chars may now be selected in
  file managers. The limit for typing in a file name is still 55
  chars.  You may not enter a blank line as a file name anymore.
+ Fixed segfault when attempting to read THIS_COLOR for the
  global robot. It will now always return -1.

DEVELOPERS

+ Overhauled txt2hlp. Error messages now differentiate between
  hyperlinks and labels and will take the display chars and &
  into account. Eventually, the goal should be to get rid of
  txt2hlp altogether and have MZX load straight from the .txt
  file.
+ Added compile option to use uthash for counter/string lookups
  as opposed to binary search. Ideally, this will vastly improve
  lookup speeds for large numbers of counters/strings, but will
  consume more memory. (thanks to Lancer-X for the modified
  uthash header file)

June 20, 2012 - MZX 2.84b

Less than three weeks after the last one, MegaZeux 2.84b is
here a few weeks early to fix a key regression regarding the
use of REL commands with the COPY x y dx dy command.  While
several new features have been added, this release was mostly
about rooting out as many crash bugs from MegaZeux as possible.
An official public beta release of debytecode has been pushed
off once again due to time constraints.

Most notable as far as new features go, pressing 'E' while a
game's title screen is running will now take you directly to
that world in the editor. A blank new world may still be
created with 'F8', and now with the 'N' key. The function key
corresponding to the new 'E' functionality is 'F9'.

A major new aspect of this version, which could be seen as a
bugfix or as a new feature, is MegaZeux's ability to validate
the MZX, MZB, MZM, and SAV file formats. Validation has been
rigorously tested and refined, and a comprehensive list of most
world files that fail any check is available on the MZX Wiki.
File load crashes and force-quit "Out of memory" errors in
these instances are nearly a thing of the past.

One final major change regards the file manager dialogs (Load /
Save Game, etc). These dialogs have been internally overhauled
to avoid permanent directory changes unless a valid world or
save file has been loaded.  If any bugs are experienced using
these, they should be reported to the MZX Bug Tracker.

FEATURES

+ Pressing 'E' or 'F9' on a title screen will now open the
  current world for editing.  Press 'N' or 'F8' to create a new
  world.
+ Multiple hosts may now be defined in config.txt. Update
  attempts will be carried out in the order they are defined.
+ A startup path may be defined in config.txt ("startup_path").
+ Specifying the backup filename with a directory, ex.
  "backup/file", will now silently attempt to create the
  directory if it does not exist.
+ MZM3 is now forward compatible (robots will be dummied out).

BUGFIXES

+ World validation has been strengthened, preventing
  disasterous loads of most non-world files.  Mostly
  intact/valid worlds, such as HUNTDRAK.MZX, can be loaded --
  corrupt/missing boards will be replaced with blank boards,
  corrupt robots will be replaced by robots with empty
  programs, and so on.  If more robots/scrolls/signs are found
  on a board than their data suggests there should be, the
  extras will be replaced with customblocks. Back up the
  version of the world with errors in this instance, as the
  robots' code or scroll text may still be salvageable from the
  world data.
+ Fixed a long-standing memory corruption bug in the shoot
  command introduced by the port.
+ Mac OS X: MegaZeux now uses /Users/[username] as the default
  starting directory. Apps previously would always start at the
  filesystem root. (ajs)
+ Fixed dangerous crash-causing bug where the editor would not
  chdir back to the correct directory after testing.
+ MegaZeux, after saving a world to a new directory, now chdirs
  to the new current world file's directory.
+ Changed behavior where a failed save file load would fade the
  still-running world out of focus. MegaZeux now leaves the
  world in focus.
+ All failed world/save loads leave the current world running
  and in the same working directory.
+ When startup_file is defined as a directory at the command
  line, MZX chdirs to the directory instead of attempting to
  open it as a world file.  In the config file, the directory
  is pruned off since there's a new config option for the
  startup path.
+ Fixed regression where the rel commands would be ignored for
  board to board copy x y dx dy.
+ Updated MZX_SPEED in the counter debugger, where it was still
  getting clamped from 1 to 9.
+ COLOR FADE IN and COLOR FADE OUT (and all built-in uses of
  them) now correctly respect any COLOR INTENSITY changes made
  before they are used.
+ In file selection dialogs, when attempting to make a
  directory that already exists with ALT+N, MZX now shows the
  correct file name and does not force the user to quit
  MegaZeux.
+ In file selection dialogs, when pressing ALT+D with a
  directory selected, MZX now correctly prompts to delete the
  selected directory instead of a file.
+ The option to import world files in the board editor now
  correctly takes the world version into account.
+ Savegame MZMs loaded into the editor now have their robots
  dummied out for safety purposes.
+ Fixed bug where INPUT STRING would not terminate lines longer
  than 71 chars after clipping them.
+ INPUT STRING and ASK do not allow either tabs (INPUT only) or
  line breaks (both) anymore.
+ Fixed bug where putting a scroll/sign in the editor buffer
  and then selecting something else could cause a crash on
  leaving the editor.

+ Temporary fix for MSVC bug where all window dialogs would
  freeze. (MZXGiant)
+ Temporary fix: board block actions will not corrupt robot
  source code in DBC anymore. (MZXGiant)

DEVELOPERS

+ Switched debian prereq. and darwin libpng12 to libpng,
  switched darwin and default ldflags to use '--ldflags'
  instead of '--libs'.
+ Darwin CC/CXX compiler can now be specified on the command
  line. (ajs)
+ Cleaned up broken ifeq structure in darwin Makefile.in so
  ARCHes other than i686 can be built.
+ Updated MSVC dirent.h to the latest version (MZXGiant)
+ Added updated MSVC dependencies. (MZXGiant)

June 01, 2012 - MZX 2.84

The first version of MegaZeux to be released in two and a half
years, this time with a vast number of bugfixes, several new
features, and hopefully no new bugs.

There's a new port to the Pandora platform from Exophase. There
are no binaries for this platform yet, as ajs has not had time
to set up the cross-compiler. Same goes for Android.

Another major (internal) change this time around is that
Exophase's experimental "debytecode" language modification has
been merged. This still has some major bugs open against it,
and missing features, so I won't be doing official releases
yet. You can add support for this feature by passing
"--enable-debytecode" to config.sh on all platforms.

Thanks to Terryn, Exophase and MZXGiant for their contributions
and to Lancer-X, Old-Sckool and Lachesis who reported and
tracked the majority of bugs this time round.

FEATURES
+ Added experimental port to Pandora. See arch/pandora/README
  for more information. (Exophase)
+ Directories may now be opened with FREAD_OPEN.  This
  functionality can be used in conjunction with FREAD_POS and
  SET "$str" FREAD. FREAD will set the string to "" when it has
  reached the end of the file listing.
+ MZX_SPEED can now be set up to 16 by a robot or from the F2
  dialog menu. (Lachesis)
+ Numbers can now be temporarily backspaced past their minimum
  value to make typing a new number more intuitive in dialogs.
  (Lachesis)
+ Chars 0 and 255 can now be selected from the Edit Chars
  submenu of the Global Info menu. Using char 255 on a kind
  that would have previously denied it now gives a warning
  dialog. (Lachesis)
+ New Counter: SPACELOCK represents the default space
  functionality for the built-in player. Setting this counter
  to 0 disables it, allowing the player to move as normal when
  space is pressed. Setting it back to 1 enables it again.
  Defaults to 1. (Lachesis)
+ New Counter: FREAD_DELIMITER allows you to change the
  terminating char for the string FREAD function.  The
  terminating char still defaults to '*'. A complementary
  FWRITE_DELIMITER function has been added as well. (Lachesis)
+ New Counter: ARCTANdy,dx takes two values and returns the
  angle with corrected quadrants as an alternative to using
  ATANdy with DIVIDER as dx, which was less intuitive and never
  documented properly. (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: MINv1,v2 and MAXv1,v2 return the minimum or
  maximum value between two inputs, respectively. Chain several
  of these in an expression or a loop for more arguments.
  (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: bchX,Y; bcoX,Y; bidX,Y; and bprX,Y are new
  shorthand access counters for BOARD_CHAR, BOARD_COLOR,
  BOARD_ID, and BOARD_PARAM.  The same limitations to those
  counters apply to the new ones. (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: uchX,Y; ucoX,Y; uidX,Y; and uprX,Y are new
  shorthand access counters for the board's under layer.  The
  same limitations apply to these as to their board
  counterparts.  Additionally, these counters will fail if the
  same spot on the normal board is occupied by a floor-type
  (space, [dir]water, lava, fake, etc...). (Lachesis)
+ New Counters: ochX,Y and ocoX,Y are new shorthand access
  counters for the overlay.  Like OVERLAY_CHAR and
  OVERLAY_COLOR, these are read-only to discourage the user
  from writing to these instead of using the much faster PUT
  [color] [char] OVERLAY [x] [y]. (Lachesis)
+ Pressing ALT+G from the world editor now goes directly to the
  Global Robot without having to skip through the Global Info
  menu. (Lachesis)
+ MZM3 has been enabled for 2.84 and all following versions.
  The difference between MZM3 and MZM2 is that MZM3 stores a
  copy of the world version, allowing the robot format to
  change. (Lachesis)
+ COPY can now take + and # prefixes to its arguments. COPY
  BLOCK and COPY OVERLAY BLOCK can now take + prefixes to their
  first set of coordinates. (Lachesis)
+ Subroutine versions of TOUCH, BOMBED, INVINCO, PUSHED,
  PLAYERSHOT, NEUTRALSHOT, ENEMYSHOT, SHOT, PLAYERHIT, LAZER,
  SPITFIRE, GOOPTOUCHED, PLAYERHURT, KEY[char], KEYENTER, THUD,
  and EDGE have been added. These should ALWAYS be used in
  conjunction with LOCKSELF/ZAP and #RETURN or #TOP to keep the
  robot stack under control.  Please remember that THUD and
  EDGE ignore LOCKSELF and their subroutine versions must be
  ZAPped. JUSTENTERED, JUSTLOADED, and the sensor labels have
  been excluded from this due to various reasons. (Lachesis)

BUGFIXES

+ Fixed a bug where LOAD_ROBOT or LOAD_BC would not reset the
  stack pointer for newly loaded programs. This could cause
  crashes if a robot popped the stack in the new program.
+ Fixed a bug where range checking of BOARD_X and BOARD_Y would
  sometimes not be done correctly, leading to crashes.
+ Strings in the debug menu list no longer interpret any color
  codes they may contain.
+ Fixed a bug where a string would not be interpreted correctly
  if it used a '.' character in a splice parameter expression.
  Expressions such as IF "$str#('$str2.length'-4)" = "blah"
  THEN "label" will now work correctly.
+ Fixed negative sprN_cheight et al from crashing. (Exophase)
+ Placement of objects on the player will be blocked with an
  error dialog like DOS versions, instead of silently failing
  after setup. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed a bug where LOAD_ROBOT would not properly parse lines
  of imported code that had leading whitespace. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed an integer wrapping bug in debytecode, disallowed
  numeric literals outside of the bounds of a signed short.
  (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed a bug that would corrupt the UI palette if "set color"
  was run against a color index over 15. (MZXGiant)
+ If either board dimension is less than the editor viewport,
  the character and colors used to indicate space outside of
  the board are taken from protected sets. In game, they are
  taken from the game's sets.
+ Increase limit on difference for RANDOM "A" TO "B" to
  UINT_MAX rather than INT_MAX - 1 as it was previously. Since
  the entire range represented by a counter is now usable,
  there are no cases where RANDOM will "break".
+ Fixed avalanche rings and potions to limit boulder placement
  to 1/18, matching the AVALANCHE command.
+ Fixed corruption and possible crashes when using VIEWPORT
  SIZE to set the viewport to a size less than 80x25 but
  greater than the current board dimensions. The viewport will
  now always be clamped to board size.
+ Fixed incorrectly changing horizontal mouse position on
  setting MOUSEY. (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed overflow into protected character set when "Revert
  to..." is selected in the character editing dialog.
  (MZXGiant)
+ Music and SFX now mute when the updater launches and are
  restored when it is complete. (MZXGiant)
+ Fixed odd string behaviour when copying between strings that
  happen to be stored close to each other in memory. This fixes
  a regression introduced by the "crash when pasting to and
  from the same string" fix in 2.82b.
+ The size/offset parameters for strings can now be specified
  in either order (#+ vs +#) and will behave correctly.
+ Reverted bogus cycle-ending behaviour for SHOOT,
  SHOOTMISSILE, SHOOTSEEKER and SPITFIRE.
+ Improved cycle-ending compatibility with MZX versions prior
  to 2.80. Fixes games such as Kya's Sword and Stones & Roks
  II.
+ Restored shark's ability to move in goop.
+ MZX now clears SPR_YORDER upon loading a new world.
+ When transitioning between boards, MZX now compares the
  module filenames of the source and destination boards
  case-insensitively. A difference in case will no longer cause
  the board module to be incorrectly restarted.
+ Fixed rare rendering corruption in the load game dialog.
+ Fixed a bug where SEND "robot" TO "#return" could corrupt the
  program counter of the target robot if it had a stack pointer
  of zero.
+ Fixed some security issues with SMZX_PALETTE and LOAD_BC
  counters.
+ MZX now only lists/opens regular files or symlinks to regular
  files in file dialogs. Special files are now ignored.
+ Opening directories with FWRITE_OPEN is now rejected properly
  on all platforms.
+ Fixed a bug where a file would be re-opened for read/write,
  even if the file was missing or an I/O error occurred before
  saving.
+ Fixed a bug where MZX could occasionally crash due to label
  list corruption when copying robots from heap locations
  greater than 2^32 bytes apart (only affected 64bit builds).
+ Stopped SET "var" <command> from assembling. Some invalid
  uses of command tokens were already being ignored, but this
  was just luck.
+ Sprites with color c?? (inherited "natural" colors) will
  correctly inherit the colors of special characters such as
  the player and other self-colored built-ins.
+ Debytecode's legacy expression converter should use
  is_string() instead of its own (buggy) hand-rolled version.
  Fixes crash when converting CoAZ.
+ The editor no longer incorrectly clamps the intelligence of
  sharks, spitting tigers and spiders to <=4, and no longer
  clamps the HP of dragons to <=4. (Lancer-X)
+ MZX now accepts SET EDGE COLOR "string" in addition to SET
  EDGE COLOR c??.
+ Fixed NDS port initialization on DSi devices. (asiekierka)
+ Fixed a bug in the joystick code where centering an axis
  clears the previous axis button. (iamgreaser)
+ Fixed a bug that allowed vlayer->board COPY BLOCK to
  overwrite the player. Blocks that would overwrite the player
  are now ignored.
+ Fixed a 2.81e regression that allowed SENDs to self to ignore
  LOCKSELF.
+ Setting $str.length now makes $str the length specified.
  (Lachesis)
+ Caps Lock no longer interferes with dialog box text input.
  (Lachesis)
+ Increasing the size of a string with $str.length, $str.N, or
  with a splice now wipes old string data with char 32s.
+ Dialogs (especially "Exit gameplay - Are you sure?") now
  require the user to have actually hit ESC to close, making
  escaping busyloops and message loops much easier. (Lachesis)
+ Added a compatibility fix for different label caching in 2.80
  through 2.83 that allowed constructs such as : "LABEL" / SEND
  "ALL" "LABEL" on an unlocked robot to continue instead of
  getting caught in a loop. The altered label caching caused
  #98485 Thanatos Insignia to lock up in an unescapable
  busyloop in GIT versions. (Lachesis)
+ MOD "[lead-in file]*" now works properly. In previous
  versions of the port, this construct would result in the
  lead-in file failing to play and the wildcard mod restarting
  when the player re-entered and re-exited the board.
  (Lachesis)
+ Fixed a bug where mod "*" would cause the mod to restart when
  entering another board with the same playing mod. (Lachesis)
+ ALT+D (Default palette) now requires a confirmation.
  (Lachesis)
+ The COMMANDS counter is now saved as a 32-bit variable.
  (Lachesis)
+ The LOOPCOUNT counter has been moved to save-only data and is
  now saved as a 32-bit variable. (Lachesis)
+ Fixed a bug where not all whirlpools were being considered as
  such, notably during the transport board scan. (Lachesis)
+ The abilities of PLAY "&file&" to play at multiple
  frequencies and to parse multiple files have been restored.
  (Lachesis)
+ As of MZX 2.84, BOARD_COLOR will now ignore the under color
  of any object with a BG color of 0 that is on top of
  something.  Worlds that relied on this between 2.80 and 2.83
  are unaffected. (Lachesis)
+ Setting BIMESG to 0 will now disable Game Over's
  auto-centering of the message row. (Lachesis)
+ The DIVIDER counter's documentation has been updated to
  explain its true purpose.
+ Fixed an editor bug where canceling a world load could cause
  MZX to forget the filename of the current world. (Lachesis)
+ Pressing ALT+M in the world editor now edits anything with
  parameters, not just Robots, Signs/Scrolls, and Sensors.

DEVELOPERS

+ Source tarballs are now generated in XZ (LZMA2) format.
+ Make hlp2txt utility work correctly on Windows platforms.
+ Updated and repaired MSVC project for Visual Studio 2010.
  (MZXGiant)
+ Win32 binaries are built ASLR-capable (via pefix).
+ Version control was changed from SVN to Git; the repo is at:
  http://github.com/ajs1984/megazeux
+ The EGL backend now supports Mesa's EGL implementation on
  X11.
+ Imported libmodplug 0.8.8.4 and rebased all patches.
+ Introduced SOCKS4/4a/5 support transparently into the network
  layer. (MZXGiant)

December 29, 2009 - MZX 2.83

It's been a year since the last release, due in part to my
reduced free time, and less contribution from other developers
in 2009. I'd also like to believe that 2.82b was such a good
release, there was no need to rush.

There's over 30 bugs fixed this time. A few features I had to
withhold for 2.82b have been added; sample loop markers and
some changes to the board file format necessitated the bump to
2.83. Logicow's GLSL renderer has finally made it in (various
bits had to be re-written to extend portability to other
platforms).

There's a new (semi-complete) Android port this time; I hope to
complete it, and provide binaries for Android 2.0 phones, in
2.83b.

Thanks go out to the usual suspects -- Terryn, Mr_Alert,
Logicow, kvance, Lancer-X, revvy and Exophase -- for supporting
development this year.

USERS

+ Added support for loop markers in WAV and OGG files. The WAV
  loop support uses the "smpl" chunk used by ModPlug Tracker
  and Wavosaur among others. Only the first loop is used, and
  only forward looping is supported. The OGG loop support uses
  the "LOOPSTART" and "LOOPLENGTH" tags as used by RPG Maker
  VX. (Mr_Alert)
+ Added OpenGL Shader Language (glsl) renderer which uses
  shaders to render and scale the video. This renderer is
  compatible with Open GL >=2.0 and Open GL-ES 2.0 video cards
  only. A variety of shader programs have been provided and
  these can be customized. Performance of all MZX modes
  (including SMZX) is excellent. (Logicow, ajs)
+ Files will no longer be silently overwritten by save dialogs
  if the user enters an existing filename without the default
  extension. (revvy)
+ The string editor in the counter debug menu (F11) now escapes
  newlines and backslashes to prevent UI corruption.
+ Fixed a bug where the LOAD_GAME counter handler could
  continue to use the old board state after load, causing
  crashes. (Lancer-X)
+ Fixed a bug where status counters containing numbers >6
  characters would cause MegaZeux to crash or behave strangely.
+ Fixed a bug in the robot editor's find/replace function that
  caused crashes when replacing a string with another longer
  string, with a replacement at the end of a line.
+ Programmatically writing to a read-only "built-in" counter
  will no longer allocate it general heap space. This prevents
  writes from showing up in the F11 counter debugger that are
  inaccessible from robotic.
+ Fixed a bug that caused the SMZX mode 3 palette to become
  corrupted upon entering the char editor (the editor would
  re-write colours 2-4 and not restore them from backup
  correctly).
+ Fixed a bug where a robot program would never progress if the
  subroutine stack was popped more times than it was pushed
  (via return or top).
+ On UNIX platforms a desktop/menu entry is now installed by
  default, using the existing icon. (Sci-freak)
+ Clamp score to >= 0 if world <= 2.70. Fixes "Gates: The
  Puzzles" and possibly other old titles depending on this
  behavior. (Exophase)
+ Fullscreen modes will now automatically use your current
  desktop resolution if using any hardware renderer (i.e. not
  the default software renderer). To get the old behaviour back
  you must set fullscreen_resolution explicitly.
+ Fixed a bug where web and thick web would be treated the
  same.
+ Fixed a bug in the updater where modified/replaced files
  would be considered for deletion.
+ Fixed a bug on case-sensitive filesystems where saving a
  game, world or MZM could fail to overwrite any existing file
  by the same name (if matched case insensitively).
+ MZX no longer applies masking to chars 32-127 in signs or
  scrolls when playing a world. Previously, even the 
  mask_midchars option would have no effect on the display of
  signs or scrolls. This has been broken since 2.80g.
+ Re-worked board editor's Alt+H option to provide minimal
  editor (one row) status info, rather than completely hiding
  the help.
+ The checkres utility now checks the global robot for missing
  resources too.
+ Chests can be added with Hi Bombs (omission noted by zzo38).
+ Fix IF c?? Sprite p?? # # "label" so that a non-wildcard
  parameter is respected (previously it would always just check
  sprite 0).
+ NDS port updated from dsmzx2 release. (kvance, ajs)
+ Updated SDL to 1.2.14 in Windows x86, Windows x64 and Mac OS
  X builds.
+ Security checks are no longer applied to filenames in module
  or sample playback in "listening only" modes in the editor.
+ Module volume is applied immediately before playback upon
  switching boards. This prevents one cycle of audio "leaking"
  at the wrong volume.
+ Prevent crash with negative string clip where clip + offset =
  0. Clip is now correctly limited to total string length.
+ Help file is now optional for MZXRun, even with
  CONFIG_HELPSYS=1 builds.
+ Fixed crash when robot editor macros expanded other macros.
+ The lock icon is no longer missing from the Items THING menu
  (F4).
+ A world to start up with can now be passed to MegaZeux
  without the startup_file= prefix. This makes megazeux
  consistent with other applications.
+ SHOOT, SHOOTMISSILE, SHOOTSEEKER and SPITFIRE now end the
  cycle, to restore compatibility with pre-port MZX and fix
  games such as Kya's Sword and Stones & Roks II.
+ Have IF [dir] PLAYER [color] [thing] [param] "label"
  interpret SEEK direction wrt robot coordinates, rather than
  player coordinates. Other directions are not affected.
+ Zapping a label at the end of a robot program will no longer
  corrupt the robot list (which usually caused crashes).
+ Entering lines in the robot editor with leading or trailing
  spaces will be trimmed before the line is compiled.
+ The single quote characters encasing S_CHARACTER parameters
  in the robot editor will now use the protected (GUI) charset
  rather than the game one.
+ Added a "system_mouse" config.txt option that allows the
  mouse cursor to be replaced with the system mouse cursor,
  rather than being drawn by MegaZeux.
+ Disallowed placing player clones with SET "board_id" 127.
+ Relaxed file name limit on board MOD file. The board MOD can
  now be as long as the limit imposed by file dialog's input
  box (previously limited to 12 characters).
+ Truncation of currently open input/output file names will now
  only occur at MAX_PATH bytes (typically 512 characters). The
  previous limit was 13 characters.
+ Relaxed limit of INPUT string and bottom ("*") messages from
  80 characters to ROBOT_MAX_TR (512) characters. In the case
  of bottom messages this can be usefully exploited to ~200
  characters.
+ Progress meter will be shown for world decrypt on console
  platforms.
+ Fixed a bug where a malformatted BMP header would be written
  (length too short, didn't include dummy channel in BMP
  palette). (Mr_Alert)
+ Optimized audio locking; do file I/O outside of critical
  sections to decrease stalling, particularly on platforms with
  slow I/O. (Mr_Alert)
+ Added support for MacOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and removed
  support for 10.3.
+ Loading a save game from robotic will now correctly restore
  intensities to their saved values.
+ Copy/pasting a block either with COPY BLOCK or the editor,
  where the copy would exceed the limit on robots/signs/scrolls
  /sensors, will no longer place junk at the target
  co-ordinates. Instead, the object's background will be copied
  in isolation.
+ Pasting from the clipboard, expanding a macro,  or importing
  .txt or .bc files that would cause a robot to exceed the 64k
  limit now has the operation ignored at the point it exceeds
  the limit, rather than adding an unlimited number of
  unrecognized lines.

DEVELOPERS

+ MZXRun compilation can now be disabled. Compilation of
  pre-2.82b style non-modular builds requires
  `--disable-modular --disable-mzxrun'.
+ Disabling SDL can now be done with --disable-sdl and the
  resulting configuration will automatically disable any
  SDL-dependent components. This is useless to anybody except
  developers doing new ports.
+ Game directory, utility directory and resource directories
  can now be specified and will be respected on "make install".
  (Sci-freak, ajs)
+ Added experimental port to Android. See arch/android/README
  for more information.
+ Ported opengl1 and opengl2 renderers to OpenGL ES 1.x and
  glsl renderer to OpenGL ES 2.0, used increasingly by mobile
  devices.
+ Removed SDL dependency from NDS port. It only used it for
  timing and stuffed events.
+ On Windows platforms, binaries are processed with the `pefix'
  in-tree tool to eliminate data section differences in
  programs with identical texts. This minimizes the amount of
  content required to be sent for updates.
+ Updated Wii port: improved audio and video support, added USB
  mouse support, numerous optimizations and improved file
  selector. (Mr_Alert)

December 29, 2008 - MZX 2.82b

This release contains plenty of important bug fixes, ranging
from regressions such as the broken command-line editor macro
expansion to third party bugs like the Windows "directx" SDL
video driver breakage.

There are also some new ports and features. MegaZeux now runs
on the Wii (port by Mr_Alert) and AmigaOS 4.x (port by myself
and Spot from os4depot). The Windows x64 port has matured
immensely and can now be considered stable. MacOS X builds now
have clipboard support. The hardware stretching renderers now
have a couple of fixed aspect ratio modes.

The biggest feature of this release is the introduction of a
portable network layer, which is currently being tested by the
new built-in updater (F7/U).

Internally, MegaZeux is now modularized and builds as several
DLL and EXE files, which should make redesigning parts like the
help system and editor a little easier, as well as allowing us
to ship a "mzxrun" executable for the first time since 2.69c.
This "mzxrun" executable is now used by a majority of the
console ports.

Contributions from Revvy, Mr_Alert, Terryn and Exophase have
helped make this another solid release.

USERS

+ Writing to $str.length (which previously did undefined
  things) will now truncate or enlarge the string to the size
  specified.
+ Removed filename size limit for FWRITE_MODIFY and
  FWRITE_APPEND. (Revvy)
+ Added support to the checkres tool to check worlds in
  non-local directories. (Revvy)
+ Fixed an old bug with saving games and worlds from Robotic
  where a board could be prematurely "optimized", renumbering
  robot IDs within the same cycle. For commands like DIE this
  could cause unpredictable behaviour or simply crashes (if
  invoked in the same cycle). As a special case, end the cycle
  if either of these SET specials are used.
+ Mistaken or malicious file I/O such as set "$test" to
  "fread(-1>>1)" will no longer crash MegaZeux. The read size
  will be truncated to a contextual maximum for the current
  file.
+ Fixed a crash using "fwrite0" in conjunction with an empty
  string.
+ Fixed a bug where checking sprite_collisions on a disabled
  target sprite would unconditionally trigger (regardless of
  whether a collision was present or not).
+ Un-grouped the handling of the KEY and KEYn counters so that
  different compatibility checks can be applied to either
  counter. Fixes "Bocco Chronicles 1" and probably several
  other titles.
+ Fixed a crash when using RIDn or ROBOT_ID_n in the same cycle
  as DIE for another robot positioned earlier in the board
  scan.
+ Fixed poor sanity checks on BOARD_ID counter writes. Illegal
  character IDs such as -1 can no longer be used to bypass the
  check (causing subsequent crashes).
+ Windows builds now use a patched version of SDL 1.2.13
  containing a fix for the directx+F10 issue.
+ Fixed a bug where one robot could send another robot to
  "#return", with an address outside its program. In such
  cases, the robot will now terminate.
+ An "mzxrun" binary is now shipped alongside the
  editor-capable MZX binary.
+ Fixed TIME/TIMERESET overflows with very large values. Board
  timeout is now programmatically limited to 32767, which is
  consistent with the Board Info control.
+ Clamped CHAR_X/CHAR_Y properly so that negative numbers can
  no longer be used to corrupt the editor charset and
  potentially other process memory.
+ Fixed recent breakage of SHIFT+F{1,2,3,4} so that the
  percentage of time spent displaying the original character
  and the '!' are equal.
+ Removed some bogus handling of lines containing "only" ';',
  ',' or ' '.
+ Honor user's robot character selection if they are holding
  shift when pressing return or space (would previously always
  return char 247).
+ Backspacing a line and then expanding a macro no longer
  restores the original line contents immediately after the
  expansion.
+ MacOS 10.x clipboard support (via Cocoa Pasteboard). Alt+Ins
  can be entered with Fn+Alt+Numpad0 on a Macbook or Powerbook
  keyboard.
+ Robot editor S_CHARACTER fields no longer bogusly escape
  characters such as ". In addition, rendering glitches are no
  longer encountered when using the ' S_CHARACTER (which is
  completely reasonable).
+ Fixed robot editor glitches where the game charset SPACE
  would be used in places where the protected UI charset should
  be used instead.
+ The introductory help message is displayed if the load dialog
  is cancelled prior to loading a game. Hopefully the screen is
  now never totally blank.
+ The F7/F8 cheats can now be used freely in MZXRun (in
  MegaZeux proper they remain usable only in editor tests).
+ Saving to a directory above the MegaZeux startup directory,
  then attempting to save to this location again, will no
  longer crash MegaZeux. Instead, the parent directory will be
  changed into before the dialog is displayed.
+ Fixed numerous crash bugs with the scroll editor; it should
  be relatively usable now.
+ Writing to $str+0 is no longer interpreted in the same way as
  a plain write to $str. Instead, it behaves like writes to
  non-zero offsets (as more of a paste than a replace).
+ Display of current X,Y position of robot in the robot editor
  status bar.
+ Fixed directory rename so that it no longer displays garbage
  and/or crashes MegaZeux (Alt+R to rename a directory in any
  file picker).
+ In the robot editor, lines can now be split at a midpoint
  with enter and two consecutive lines merged together with
  backspace. (Exophase)
+ Fixed use of status counter 6 and display of status counters
  in general, which has been broken since 2.80.
+ Fixed swapping to encrypted worlds if initially the user
  decides to not decrypt the world. Previously, this would
  either crash, or loop forever.
+ When using the OpenGL or overlay renderers, in either
  windowed or fullscreen mode, the aspect ratio can now be
  preserved as either 4:3 (most similar to DOS) or 64:35 (most
  similar to the port). The display will be letterboxed or
  margins applied as appropriate. See the "video_ratio"
  configuration option for more information.
+ Fixed a bug on some systems where numlock could not be used
  as a key, only as a flag. The numlock "key" is now masked out
  of "key_code" and similar; hopefully this won't break any
  games.
+ Restored the meter widget from the old DOS MZX for use with
  the world loader and saver routines. This reassures users,
  especially on consoles, where loading a world can take a long
  time. (Mr_Alert)
+ On Windows, directx.bat now passes %cd% through to `start' so
  that features such as the updater continue to work.
  (MZXGiant)
+ Pasting into a string with set "$str+N" with an N > 
  str.length will no longer crash MZX.
+ "Exit to DOS" is now "Exit MegaZeux" to reflect the
  multi-platform nature of the program.
+ Setting a substring size to zero with $string#0 will no
  longer return the whole string; it will instead return the
  empty string.
+ Accessing a substring with an offset >= $string.length will
  no longer return the last character from the string; it will
  instead return the empty string.
+ Writing beyond MAX_STRING_LEN (1MB) or using negative offsets
  (which has the same effect) no longer crashes. Instead, the
  write is ignored.
+ Fixed crash when pasting to and from the same string,
  specifically in conjunction with $str+offset.
- Removed the legacy "force_resolution" option which was
  replaced long ago by the more accurate
  "fullscreen_resolution" option.

DEVELOPERS

+ Ported to OpenSolaris. You need to install `SUNWxorg-headers'
  if you want X11 clipboard support.
+ Removed dependency on SDL_image on non-win32 platforms when
  enabling the icon branding feature (see pngops.c).
+ Ported to AmigaOS. You need to install the clib2 version of
  libSDL and miniGL, and the build system assumes you are using
  a cross compiler.
+ Added experimental port to the Wii. See arch/wii/README for
  more information. (Mr_Alert)
+ get_path() in util.c now returns <0 for failure, or the
  length of the path for the given file. (Revvy)
+ Added the make time WHOLE_PROGRAM=1 flag which enables
  compilation of the core binary in GCC's "-fwhole-program
  --combine" mode. This makes all symbols static and improves
  optimization, somewhat like MSVC's LTO does.
+ Added a valgrind.supp file to suppress bugs in third party
  libraries when valgrinding MegaZeux.
+ Cleaned up all the ports and documented making new ports. The
  platforms "linux", "solaris" and "obsd" are now called
  "unix", and the "linux-static" platform is now "unix-devel"
  and available on all UNIX derivatives/clones.
+ Added a special hack to enable linking with --as-needed for
  DT_NEEDED link optimization for GNU ld platforms.
+ Updated MSVC projects. Fixed all warnings emitted by MSVC
  2008, and implemented icon support with existing mingw
  resource files.
+ Now uses the GNU ld "debuglink" feature on all platforms to
  enable shipping of a side-by-side symbol package. Optimized
  release builds can now be debugged with minimal user effort.
+ MegaZeux now provides the option for "modular" linkage,
  factoring out the "core", "editor" and "network" features to
  shared objects that other binaries can link against. This
  feature works on the unix, mingw, amiga and darwin ports.
+ Added RPM .spec file. Capable of building (at least) Fedora
  10 RPMs.
- Removed HOST_CC feature for cross compilation; since the
  utilities now intimately depend on the MZX runtime, they must
  be built with the same compiler.

June 10, 2008 - MZX 2.82

Despite the increase in minor version, this release mostly
targets bug and regression fixes. However, there ARE some
additional new features, such as the introduction of the
LOAD_MENU and mouse pixel counters, and refinement of the
{FREAD,FWRITE}_COUNTER counters. (There are several other
smaller features that are documented in the changelog.)

SAVs from older worlds (requiring compatibility hacks) no
longer fail to play (Darkness, etc. are affected). We've also
done a good bit to fix compatibility with 2.70 and older.

A new tool, "checkres", is now routinely packaged, allowing you
to check your games for missing resource files (PALs, CHRs,
etc.) before passing them on to other people. This should be
especially handy for DoZ game submissions.

The Nintendo DS port (Kevin Vance's "DsMZX") has been merged
into this release. I'll provide binaries for GP2X, PSP and NDS
this time, but I can't guarantee they'll work.

Both of the snags from the last DoZ have been addressed -- the
help system should no longer crash and the Block Action crashes
should be reduced in frequency. However, there are still issues
with pasting in the robot editor that remain unfixed (they're
just really hard to reproduce). With your bug reports, I look
forward to fixing this.

As usual, thanks go out to Revvy and Mr_Alert for their
contributions to the bug-fixing effort, and to Terryn for his
unwavering dedication to creating and organising bug reports,
and for testing our bug fixes.

USERS

+ Fixed and improved quality of the half-width renderer for the
  GP2X port (Mr_Alert).
+ The numpad now works correctly when numlock is disabled. Keys
  are no longer ignored by the MZX editor, and games should
  recognize them as before.
+ Added a tool, "checkres", which extracts all resources from a
  MegaZeux world or board file and lists them (or lists only
  those which are not found in the game directory). ZIP files
  are also supported (to a more limited extent). (ajs & Revvy,
  ideas from Exophase & Terryn).
+ Removed the bogus "F1 for Help" option from error dialogs,
  and finally got rid of the "** BETA **" banner on title
  boards in play mode.
+ Obsoleted support for the AMS, DBM, DMF, MDL, MT2, PSM, PTM
  and UMX module formats. As noted for several versions in the
  help file, these are not loadable by MikMod. It is extremely
  unlikely any game uses these obscure formats, but denying
  their use is now enforced (at a robotic level).
+ Fixed crash when writing to an MZX string at an illegal
  offset (< 0).
+ Fixed returning from a subroutine invoked by a jump from a
  MZX text box class command so that it no longer skips the
  next impending line (after the text box).
+ Assembled single non-alphanum/punctuation characters as
  bytecode CHARACTER instead of bytecode STRING. Fixes bogus
  auto-quoting for commands like SCROLL CHAR (Revvy).
+ Switched the Win32 package back to using the "windib" SDL
  video driver, instead of the "directx" SDL video driver. The
  windib.bat file has been replaced with directx.bat, which has
  opposing semantics.
+ SAM/GDMs with converted WAV/S3M counterparts of zero length
  will be automatically re-converted. This hack can be used to
  procedurally regenerate WAV files from SAMs, or transparently
  work around on-disk corruption.
+ Strings are now limited to a maximum length of 1M. I'm open
  to suggestions over a better limit, but there must be a limit
  (set "$string.X" notation grows a string arbitrarily, so
  robotic can crash MZX when a string is resized beyond a
  reasonable limit).
+ Strings, when grown, will fill gaps with ' ' instead of
  garbage. This can be useful when the string grows after using
  the set "$string.X" notation; the rest of the string is no
  longer garbage, allowing the debugger to be used.
+ A robot that does a "put c?? Thing p?? [dir] player" and
  overwrites itself will no longer leak commands. Instead, if
  the robot overwrites itself, its program will end.
+ Fixed message edges always showing up black, instead of 
  whatever color 0 is. (Revvy)
+ Changed starting/max health and lives minimum to 1 instead of
  0. (Revvy)
+ Some help system (F1) bugs have been fixed, hopefully
  mitigating some of the crashes people have been seeing.
+ Fixed a bug on Linux where fclose() on a robot-opened file
  could, on world reload, occassionally crash (due to a stale
  handle). Fixes loading Taoyarin saves multiple times in a
  row.
+ The new option "gl_vsync" has been added to allow the SDL
  "flip on vsync" in the OpenGL renderers to be forcibly
  enabled or disabled. This fixes a problem where speed 1 would
  only be as fast as the video refresh rate.
+ Setting the music volume to 0 (when using the ModPlug engine)
  now ensures that no music is audible. Previously, setting the
  volume to 0 would be equivalent to setting the volume to 1,
  which was still audible.
+ Upon exiting the initial load screen, and not entering the
  editor, the screen is now updated. This fixes rendering
  glitches in the MZX game window when overlapping the window
  with another, at the slight expense of CPU time.
+ If loading a save game from the title screen (or when no
  world has been loaded) MZX no longer sends JUSTENTERED to all
  robots. This restores compatibility with MZX 2.70 and is
  consistent with loading a save from another board.
+ Counters with 10 digits and a negative sign are no longer
  truncated in the debug menu.
+ Correctly clamped (rather than truncating) the value passed
  through to a SET COLOR. Restores compatibility with 2.70, and
  fixes Xenogenesis.
+ Improved clipboard copy behaviour on Linux. Some actions are
  still mysteriously broken.
+ Fixed replacing with a blank string in conjunction with the
  replace all Ctrl+F action in the robot editor. The cursor can
  now no longer become negative, fixing numerous possible
  crashes on search/replace.
+ Fixed loading the intrinsic SMZX palette when switching to
  SMZX modes from a game not in the same directory as the
  "smzx.pal" file.
+ Reloading a world that requires switching between SMZX and
  non-SMZX modes will now respect the world's intrinsic palette
  on the title screen. Fixes problems loading non-SMZX games
  after having an SMZX game loaded.
+ Clamped array offsets on boards. Some older MZX worlds are
  corrupted and have the endgame_{x,y} coordinates outside of
  the limits of the endgame board. Fixes "Fourth Power".
+ Where possible, versioned all counters that the port
  understands. This ensures that in the unlikely case that a
  game made with an older version of MZX (actually, with an
  older world magic) uses a counter that did not exist in that
  game's era, the port will no longer try to interpret it.
  Previously, only rid? and key? were versioned.
+ SAV files will now be stamped with the world magic of the
  world they were loaded from. This allows compatibility hacks
  to apply to SAV files as they would to worlds (ajs, Terryn,
  Mr_Alert).
+ Added LOAD_MENU counter like ENTER_MENU, F2_MENU et al. to
  allow control (from Robotic) over whether the LOAD_MENU can
  be brought up.
+ Made FREAD_COUNTER and FWRITE_COUNTER read in a DOS dword
  (32bit) instead of a DOS word (16bit). This allows modern
  post-port MZX counters to be fully represented in files.
  Compatibility with older worlds is preserved.
+ Added a new config option "board_editor_hide_help" which
  changes the default hide setting of the help text on the
  primary board editor.
+ Numerous fixes for bugs found by valgrind. (Nightwatch)
+ Icon support is now fixed and works on all platforms. On
  Windows, the icon cannot currently be changed (it is loaded
  from the EXE's resource section). Use ResHacker if you really
  want to change it.
+ Fixed a bug where either LOAD_ROBOTn or LOAD_BCn (where n was
  equal to ROBOT_ID) would alter the robot's line number rather
  than completely restart it. Due to complexities in robot
  context, this lead to the first line being skipped.
+ Added a new tool "downver" which supports drag-and-drop
  downgrading of a world or board from the version of MZX it is
  packaged with to the previous version of MZX. This tool may
  be unsafe to use -- be careful.
+ Fixed a bug in the robotic assembler which would
  occassionally emit corrupt programs with SAVE_ROBOT. These
  programs, if loaded by LOAD_ROBOT, could cause a crash.
+ Added a config.txt (or command line) option "startup_editor"
  which, if set to a non-zero value, will start MegaZeux in the
  editor with a blank world.
+ Fixed a bug where a robot's WALK processing, on entering a
  transporter, could allow subsequent commands (such as GO) to
  corrupt the board. WALK now ends the cycle in the special
  case that a robot goes through a transporter.
+ You can now directly import bytecode into the robot editor
  via the Alt+I menu. The extension for the bytecode file must
  be .bc for it to be loaded.
+ A game loading SAVs via the LOAD_GAME counter will no longer
  crash MZX if the SAV attempted is from an incompatible
  version of MZX, or in any way corrupted.
+ Fixed a crash when auto-completing lines that were greater
  than 241 characters in length after completion.
+ Added mouse pixel counters MOUSEPX and MOUSEPY. (Mr_Alert)
+ Commenting a line of maximum length (241 characters) can no
  longer grow the length of the line beyond this limit.
+ Fixed a bug causing the software renderer to fail to center
  when using a boxed fullscreen resolution. Also fixes a bug
  where the PSP platform would ignore an override of the
  force_bpp option. (Mr_Alert)
+ Fixed a bug causing macros loaded from config.txt to be
  expanded incorrectly. Relatedly, fixed a bug where #<string>
  in the robot exitor would "disappear" on entry, if there was
  no correspondingly named macro.

DEVELOPERS

+ Builds no longer initialize the SDL audio subsystem if audio
  is permanently disabled with --disable-audio.
+ Added fixes for OpenBSD to allow PNG screenshots and X11
  clipboard support to work. Tested with OpenBSD 4.2 and 
  GCC 3.3.5.
+ Updated Win32 builds with SDL 1.2.13.
+ Build and package two utilities, txt2hlp (for helpfile
  generation) and checkres, on Win32.
+ Dependencies are now correctly tracked in the build system.
  Modifying a header will automatically regenerate the minimal
  set of object files that depend on this header.
+ Out of the box MSVC support. The file "msvc.zip" in the root
  of the source package now provides a Visual Studio 2005
  project and pre-compiled dependencies. There may be stability
  issues with the resulting binary. See also the documentation
  in arch/msvc/README.txt.
+ The Nintendo DS port (a.k.a. 'dsmzx') has been merged. This
  is the most exotic port thus far, and adds features such as
  player focus (on the second display). Sound isn't working
  yet, and large games still won't play (due to lack of
  memory). See docs/nds.txt for more information. (kvance)
+ Many stack-heavy functions have been de-bloated and allocate
  large storage on the heap (if performance is not critical).
  This helps out platforms with a small, fixed stack size (such
  as NDS).
+ The built-in help system can now be disabled for embedded
  platforms. The startup check for the help file will not be
  performed if the help system is disabled, and so this file
  can be omitted from distributions.
+ The package.sh script now supports OS X, PSP, GP2X and NDS
  packaging.
+ The OS X port no longer requires Xcode. The new build system
  and package.sh can create a universal Application and
  corresponding DMG file. The new infrastructure deprecates the
  old macosx.zip method.
+ Most of the internal dependency on SDL has been removed.
  Therefore, MZX can be built (but not yet work) without SDL
  present. The only remaining component to convert is MikMod,
  but this can be disabled, so port authors can start using the
  feature right away (see config.sh). (Mr_Alert)

December 8, 2007 - MZX 2.81h

Another bugfix release with a couple of new features, in time
for the Winter 2007 Dualstream Day of Zeux. The major new
features of this release are automatic module renaming in the
editor, PNG screenshots and many improvements to MZX on
embedded platforms (like PSP and DS).

MegaZeux can now be compiled in MZXRun mode (like the old DOS
implementation) and by disabling features such as unnecessary
renderers and audio support, can be made approximately 70%
smaller.

Thanks again to Terryn for relentlessly tracking down many
serious bugs; we've tried to fix all the issues that have crept
up in the last 5 months.

Thanks too to Exophase, Mr_Alert and Wervyn for contributing to
this release; your time and help is invaluable.

Happy Holidays!

USERS

+ Added a more lenient WAV file loader so that ModPlug isn't
  relied on as much to play malformed WAV files (mostly old SAM
  conversions) (Mr_Alert).
+ Added SCORE and mzx_speed to the counter debugger
  (Mr_Alert, ajs).
+ Added a 16-bit software renderer and a half-width renderer
  for the GP2X port (Mr_Alert).
+ Made the mouse cursor in the "opengl2" renderer look more
  like the mouse cursor in the other renderers (Mr_Alert).
+ Setting vlayer_size, vlayer_width or vlayer_height to values
  less than or equal to zero would crash MegaZeux. Limited the
  smallest vlayer size to 1x1.
+ Setting vlayer_width or vlayer_height to a value larger than
  vlayer_size would crash MegaZeux. Limited the largest size of
  either dimension to a maximum of vlayer_size.
+ If selecting a module with a non 8.3 filename, MZX will now
  ask you if you want to rename it to 8.3, and do so in an
  intelligent way. This means that music can be selected in the
  editor and correctly saved (Wervyn).
+ The OpenBSD compiler detected some serious string bugs in
  MegaZeux. These have now been fixed and should eliminate some
  more potential crashes.
+ Fixed a bug where an ENERGIZER item or use of the INVINCO
  counter would cause the original player color to be corrupted
  at the end of the colour blitz.
+ Fixed a long-standing bug where set "$string" to "FWRITEn"
  would be cheerfully ignored.
+ Fixed a bug where a corrupt robot list could crash MegaZeux
  (e.g. the list from Star Quest from DoZ'02).
+ FEATURE: Screenshots are now saved in a palettized PNG file
  format. For platforms without libpng, PNG support can be
  compiled out, and BMP will be used instead.
+ Fixed a bug where changing boards in the editor could
  sometimes corrupt memory, later causing a crash (either
  testing or coming out of testing a board).
+ Fixed a sensor bug that happens when a sensor can't go
  anywhere it is told to, and the player is on it (Exophase).
+ Fixed using ABORT LOOP in some situations. Using it outside
  of a loop still has undefined semantics and this has been
  documented in the help file (Exophase).
+ Setting a board option below its numeric limit is no longer
  possible (Exophase).
+ Fixed problems with going over Robot name character limits
  using the .@ command (Exophase).
+ Fixed problems with LOAD_ROBOT freezing on a robot with no
  newline at the end of the file.
+ Fixed a problem with "Replace All" in the robotic editor that
  could sometimes cause a line to exceed 240 characters and
  crash the editor.
+ Fixed a problem with "Replace" in the robotic editor which
  could cause a line to temporarily become 241 characters and
  then truncate silently to 240 characters.
+ Fixed a bug that caused the original game palette to be lost
  when testing a game in the editor that switched between
  Regular/SMZX1 and SMZX2/3 modes. MegaZeux should now try much
  harder to preserve the user palette, regardless of game
  edits.
+ Fixed a bug causing board switching to not correctly alter
  the x,y viewport scroll leading to the display of raw memory
  and potential crashes, with differently sized boards.
+ Fixed stack corruption caused by SCROLL CHAR SOUTH, detected
  by Ubuntu's SSP (Stack Smashing Protection) enabled binary.

DEVELOPERS

+ Made the build system less verbose by default (like Linux).
  This should help make warnings (due to coding errors) easier
  to identify. If you don't like the new syntax, or need the
  command debug, you can build with "make V=1".
+ Updated Win32 builds with SDL 1.2.12.
+ Rewrote the build system to not use recursive Makefiles.
  Variable propagation was starting to be a problem, and
  recursive designs are generally discouraged.
+ Refactored the graphics rendering code to modularize the
  renderers and reduce code duplication (Mr_Alert).
+ GDM2S3M switched over to use inttypes.h instead of home-brew
  types.
+ MegaZeux now compiles on OpenBSD (and probably other BSDs).
+ Made all unnecessary global symbols static. This should
  improve compiler optimisations and correctness (Mr_Alert,
  ajs).
+ Fixed compilation of MegaZeux against SDL 1.3 SVN. However,
  this SDL version is still in development, and MegaZeux does
  not work correctly when compiled against it.
+ MegaZeux now builds with the experimental MINGW-x64 branch,
  enabling x64 binaries for Windows.
+ MegaZeux now builds with MSVC if you apply the patch from
  contrib/,megazeux-r326-replace-c99-variable-arrays-with-
  malloc-free.diff . This patch is required for MSVC because it
  makes non-compiler-specific changes (which involve converting
  from C99 variable length arrays to malloc/free) which are
  slower and should not be used with competent C99 compilers
  like GCC. Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition 2005 was used
  to build libogg, libvorbis, libsdl and MegaZeux itself. Only
  32bit builds were tested.
+ MegaZeux now has size optimisations which can reduce binary
  size when features are disabled. For example, all renderers
  can now be disabled, and when module engines are disabled,
  audio will not export any symbols.
+ The entire audio subsystem can now be disabled. This further
  reduces binary size on embedded platforms. However, SFX
  editing still remains enabled (though useless) until editor
  modularity is implemented.
+ The PSP port is now officially supported, and compiles out of
  the box. See docs/psp.txt.
+ Renamed macos platform "darwin", to reflect its true nature
  (use Xcode to build as a real Application, instead of just a
  UNIX binary). Also fixed some bogosities with robo_ed's X11
  includes on OS 10.5.
+ The editor can now be disabled, a la MZXRUN from the old DOS
  versions. Configure with --disable-editor to shrink MZX by
  about 150k.
+ MegaZeux can now be compiled with size optimisations
  (--optimize-size to config.sh) for a 20% space saving.
+ MegaZeux's core now builds with -W (basically all GCC
  warnings) plus some additional warnings that aren't switched
  on by this flag. All warnings have been fixed.

July 4, 2007 - MZX 2.81g

Again, no significant new features have been introduced in this
release. However, there have been many essential bugfixes,
including improved compatibility with games made in older
versions of MegaZeux.

Additionally, improvements have been made to the opengl2 and
overlay2 renderers, improving performance for most users. A
port of MegaZeux to the GP2X console has been added. MegaZeux
has been backported to C (rather than C++) and can operate
correctly on a CPU without a floating-point unit.

Particular thanks go out to Mr_Alert (for his valuable bug
fixes), Lancer-X (for fixing what I was too lazy to) and Terryn
(for finding many annoying bugs that nobody else could).

USERS

+ Fixed a bug in the audio code. The linear resampler was not
  taking volume into account, which broke changing the volume
  of samples (WAV and Vorbis) which cannot natively alter their
  volumes.
+ Fixed a regression in the overlay editor caused by the new
  editor space semantics.
+ Screenshots are now rendered to a separate texture using the
  8bit software renderer. This means that the hardware scalers
  will not affect the quality of the screenshot. It also fixes
  a bug when using opengl2, which would dump only a white
  screen.
+ Temporarily reverted a bugfix that broke Zeux IV - Forest of
  Ruin. I'm not dropping the bugfix, I just can't immediately
  see what's wrong.
+ Fixed a bug where setting the viewport to negative
  coordinates would crash MegaZeux. There was code to handle
  this, but it was wrong.
+ Fixed a bug that permitted the mouse y coordinate to be
  warped to row 25, which does not exist. This bug caused some
  of the renderers to crash, and the software renderer to draw
  in memory it did not possess.
+ Fixed a bug where games made before 2.68 could have available
  the "key?" counters, unsupported in that version. This caused
  collisions with counters with the key? name used with
  inc/dec/mul/div/mod. Fixes "Doom Keep".
+ Imported libmodplug 0.8.4, which adds MIDI/PAT and ABC format
  support, fixes some bugs in the mixer, and should build on
  more platforms.
  NOTE: MID files currently cannot be selected in the editor,
  because they do not play correctly.
+ Improved the performance of the "opengl2" renderer, by
  removing the convoluted 3D drawing commands and replacing
  them with 2D ones. Reduced the quad count by using an
  intermediary 80x25 texture. MegaZeux now depends on fewer GL
  features. [LogiCow]
+ Introduced an "fsafegets" to work around problems where
  robots exported by a Windows version of MegaZeux would not
  load on other platforms. This was due to differing EOL style
  and broke at least one game (Termination).
+ Renamed "force_resolution" to "fullscreen_resolution" to
  better match its semantics with the scaling renderers. The
  new name is less accurate for software render modes, but most
  people using software will not want to change it from the
  default anyway.
+ Fixed a bug where the variable-length string allocator would
  prematurely bail out when reading a string (of indeterminate
  length) from a file with the set "$var" to "FREAD" syntax.
+ Fixed a bug where more than 256 errors would crash the
  robotic checker.
+ Improved performance of the overlay2 (faster) renderer
  (Mr_Alert).
+ Made the transparent overlay "really" transparent when used
  in conjunction with sprites (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug reported by Mr_Alert where MZX would not handle
  short, non-looping mods in the editor. The editor would try
  to destroy the mod again, even after the callback had
  destroyed it (premature termination).
+ Fixed a bug with SWAP WORLD where file translation would
  occur but the result would mistakenly not be used. This broke
  some uses of SWAP WORLD on non-Windows platforms (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where using JUMP to MOD ORDER right after
  switching boards would fail due to the board music not having
  been loaded yet (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where games made before 2.80 would inadvertently
  trigger "PLAYERHURT" due to using the SET command to reduce
  the amount of health (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where player clones were generated when entering
  transports during FREEZETIME (Lancer-X).
+ Debug menu is now eradicated on leaving the editor
  (Lancer-X).
+ Debug menu is now properly painted over when the board size
  is < the editor viewport. Fixes various graphical glitches
  (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed a crash bug when playing older MZX games from read-only
  media (such as a CD) or where file-system permissions
  prohibited creating SAM conversions (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed bug where certain file formats would not be
  automatically converted if their extensions were mixed or
  upper case (e.g. OGG/SAM/GDM).
+ Restored functionality of "if lasttouch DIR" which has been
  broken since MZX 2.02.
+ Fixed a bug where attempting to decrypt a read-only world
  file would result in a crash (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed several bugs where an error loading a world file would
  result in crashes in several different situations (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug where a robot using the BECOME command to change
  into a PushableRobot or vice versa would freeze (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed memory leaks in the file selection dialog, the counter
  debugger, the collision list and the global robot (Mr_Alert).
+ Updated counter list (see docs/counter_list.txt in the
  source) (Terryn).
+ Fixed a bug where pressing escape when editing the effect of
  a ring or potion would result in an invalid parameter which
  would later cause a crash if edited again (Mr_Alert).
+ Fixed a bug in which robot-driven text boxes using option
  commands (the ? command) could overflow by two characters and
  spill over the side (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed the list box searching mechanism (used in the file
  manager and F11 counter list) and made the existing function
  more understandable. (Lancer-X).
+ Fixed a bug in which the message string given to the 'ask'
  command could spill over. Now, the 'ask' dialog resizes if
  possible, and clips when no further resizing can be performed
  (Lancer-X).
+ Clipped the 'input string' message properly, to prevent
  similar overflow.
+ Fixed a bug with the EXPLODE, DIE, DIE ITEM and BECOME
  commands when used with the global robot (would clear the
  global robot, eventually corrupting memory when in the
  editor). Presumably, these commands are bogus for the global
  robot, and have been disabled.

DEVELOPERS

+ Rewrote config.sh to use POSIX sh compatible functions, so
  that there is no dependency on the BASH interpreter.
  Surprisingly, some distributions still don't enable BASH by
  default (using csh, ash or zsh instead).
+ Ported most of MegaZeux back to C. Many more changes were
  required than I anticipated; MZX was using more C++ features
  than I expected. The only exception is audio.cpp, which
  cannot be ported back to C because it uses ModPlug's C++
  classes directly (but I plan to split this file up shortly).
  NOTE: The changes required were enormous, so I might have
  introduced some weird bugs! Please test!
+ Enabled GCC's -W flag for even more warnings, switching off
  unused parameter warnings (useful for delegates). Mostly
  typing fixes, but it found a bug in string handling.
+ No longer suppresses char-subscript warnings, and fixed up
  any remaining abuses in the tree.
+ Added manpages for 'megazeux' and other binaries for the
  Debian packages. Complied with the Debian packaging
  guidelines by providing a copyright note, listing significant
  contributors to MegaZeux.
+ Added support to the build system for supporting icons
  modularly. See contrib/icons/README for more information.
+ The debug build (make DEBUG=1) now enables GCC 4.x's stack
  protector. This breaks compatibility with GCC 3.x, but you
  can just remove the flag if you don't want to use it (the
  stack protector will improve stack corruption detection and
  provide more usable debug traces).
+ Custom Random() implementation to provide a more uniform
  number distribution. Factored out for future (better)
  implementations.
+ The audio backend (audio.cpp) has been modularised to support
  the use of mikmod instead of modplug. This should enable
  ports of MZX to platforms without an FPU, and improve
  performance on platforms with weak FPUs.
+ Added GP2X port to config.sh, based on work done by Simon
  Parzer.

January 30, 2007 - MZX 2.81f

This release is mostly about the new renderers, the first of
which was introduced in the previous version. There's also a
few important bugfixes, and a lot of internal tidy-up work. I'd
like to thank Mr_Alert, Quantum P. and LogiCow for contributing
to this release. Thanks guys.

USERS

+ Renamed the force_32bpp config option to force_bpp, in
  preparation for 16bit OpenGL render modes. This option now
  takes 8, 16 or 32. 16 is reportedly broken on Windows, so
  stick to 32 for now.
+ Added infrastructure for "pluggable" renderers. This code
  isn't perfect, but it's far better than the mess in 'e'.
  Defaults to the 'software' render mode.
+ Added Logicow's alternative OpenGL renderer. For more
  information about this renderer, see config.txt. NOTE: This
  code may be buggy! Please test!
+ Added Mr Alert's YUV overlay renderers. One does full YUV
  macropixel approximation, the other (faster) render does
  chroma supersampling. See config.txt for more information.
  NOTE: This code may be buggy! Please test!
+ Simplified Exophase's OpenGL renderer present in 'e', and
  fixed a few bugs that caused it to not work for some people.
+ Really made MegaZeux use 'directx' by default on Windows. The
  code in 'e' was non-functional. Use 'windib.bat' to run
  MegaZeux with the SDL windib driver.
+ The OpenGL renderers now have a 'filter' option that allows
  you to choose linear (where pixels are interpolated, looks
  "blurred") or nearest (where nearest-neighbour approximation
  occurs, looks "sharp").
+ Mouse warping was broken when using any of the hardware
  renderers. There should be code in there now to take account
  of this (thanks Mr_Alert).
+ Added an option 'editor_spaces_replace' which allows you to
  revert MZX's space overwrite behavior to the semantics of 'd'
  (the feature was removed in 'e'). By default, the behavior is
  unchanged (the same as 'e').
+ F6 (the debug menu) can now no longer be enabled anywhere but
  in the editor Alt-T test mode. In 'e', it was possible to
  enable on the title screen, but could not be enabled in a
  game. Like the cheats, this option is now visible only in
  test mode.
+ Fixed a bug where the global robot could be exited via some
  legal commands, in an abnormal fashion. The bug resulted in
  all the code up to the offending command being executed over
  and over.
+ Fixed a bug in the audio code. The linear resampler was not
  taking volume into account, which broke changing the volume
  of samples (WAV and Vorbis) which cannot natively alter their
  volumes.
+ Fixed a regression in the overlay editor caused by the new
  editor space semantics.
+ Temporarily reverted a bugfix that broke Zeux IV - Forest of
  Ruin. I'm not dropping the bugfix, I just can't immediately
  see what's wrong.
+ Screenshots are now rendered to a separate texture using the
  8bit software renderer. This means that the hardware scalers
  will not affect the quality of the screenshot. It also fixes
  a bug when using opengl2, which would dump only a white
  screen.
- The force_height_multiplier option has been removed. A lot of
  code wasn't properly designed to handle it, there have been
  mouse warp bugs with it for years, and nobody seems to use
  it. If people want stretching, they can choose one of the
  four hardware renderers to achieve this.
- Removed the 'lame/1337' menu feature.

DEVELOPERS

+ OpenGL can now be disabled via config.sh. This allows
  MegaZeux ebuilds to be constructed on systems that do not
  have any form of OpenGL support. (Although MZX runtime loads
  the OpenGL library, 'e' required the headers to build
  correctly. This is now no longer the case.)
+ On Windows, due to an ATi driver bug, I have provided a means
  of linking directly to opengl32.dll, instead of relying on
  the dynamic loader. This reduces binary portability, but
  fixes many bug reports of being unable to fullscreen on ATi
  video cards. See OPENGL_LINKING for more information.
+ Improved support for cross compiling with mingw32 on Linux,
  combined the win32 Makefile with this new support.
+ Rewrote the config.sh script. All of the options have
  changed, and the broken platform auto-detection has been
  removed. See ./config.sh for more information.
+ Rejigged MegaZeux's headers so that they can be used in both
  C and C++ mode. Renamed fsafeopen.cpp to fsafeopen.c.
  Hopefully by 'g' most of MegaZeux should be ported back to C,
  instead of the "C++" it is now.
+ Fixed up the 'txt2hlp' utility which Terryn has been using a
  version of to build the internal MZX help system. This binary
  is built in the source distribution, but it is not
  distributed with the MegaZeux binaries.
+ Moved some antiquated Greg code out into 'old'. No attempt
  has been made to make it compile, it is provided purely for
  reference.
+ For the windows binaries, "windib.bat" is now generated by
  package.sh and auto-generated for the name of the MegaZeux
  executable.
+ Updated Xcode package from Quantum P. (see macosx.zip).
+ Fixed an invalid assumption in config.sh where /bin/sh was
  chosen as the shell script interpreter. This should have been
  /bin/bash, as 'sh' is not required to support functions,
  which config.sh uses.
  
<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

January 19, 2007 - MZX 2.81e
 
+ Made grabbing in the editor not combine background color
  - only uses "special" in game colors for player. tell me if
  anything ends up being weird because of this.
+ Possibly fixed an obscure bug where moving something happened
  immediately if it was sent to a label by a robot further
  east/south than it and it moved north or west (has to do with
  the way robots are reverse scanned). Tell me if this changed
  any behavior for the worse and I'll change it back or try to
  work out something new.
+ Added GDMs to ctrl + n; this will, of course, auto convert
  and play the s3m.
+ Added ability to preset player locked status from board
  settings.
+ Instead added ability to debug variables (counters and
  strings) ingame with F11. There's also an option to export
  the current variables to Robotic program that sets them.
+ Fixed bug where moving a block with the player into an
  overlapping region leaves a space where the player was.
+ Fixed bug with a robot indirectly sending itself to a
  subroutine via send all or send name causing it to loop the
  send.
+ Added compatability hacks for key# prior to MZX 2.69 worlds
  and ridNAME falling through in MZX 2.70 and earlier worlds.
+ F6, F7, F8, and F11 debug/cheat keys only work in editing
  mode now (as things were prior to the port) You can still
  save/load in the editor so if you want all of these things
  you can play the game from the start there.
+ Space in the editor no longer deletes something of similar
  type that is beneath; not sure what the point of this was
  anyway.
+ Fixed bug causing cursor to clipped be out of bounds in SMZX
  char editor if changing to smaller multichar edit region.
+ Accidentally messed up screen centering in fullscreen for
  32bpp mode, fixed.
+ Added hardware scaling option. You can now supply a window
  resolution besides 640x350 and allow for window resizing if
  hardware scaling is on; this will also scale fullscreen
  output to fill the entire screen. This can slow down
  rendering somewhat.
+ Fixed bug causing flip block to crash in the editor.
+ Made blocked directions relative to the player for put dir
  player.
+ Fixed bug where putting something to a direction relative the
  player overwriting the robot could crash MZX.
+ Fixed ability to input in input boxes by clicking on their
  question string.
+ Removed the bogus patch to Modplug and correctly fixed it in
  the build system.
+ Added 'debian' subdirectory for building Debian and Ubuntu
  upstream packages. Hopefully MegaZeux will be in the primary
  pool in a few months.
+ Added OS X xcode project files (see 'macosx.zip'). Fixed many
  bugs relating to endian that caused MegaZeux to be buggy on
  big-endian architectures (like PPC). Credit goes to Quantum P
  for finding these bugs and engineering high quality
  solutions.
+ Made 'directx' the default video render again on Windows.
  NOTE: This overrides the default SDL behaviour, but will not
  be applied if you set SDL_VIDEODRIVER yourself.
+ Repaired the 'linux-static' target so that it no longer
  includes a system C++ library, which caused unpredictable
  results on distros without a static version.
+ Fixed a locking bug with the audio code that caused hangs at
  startup on OS X. Also provided a mutex implementation using
  GNU pthreads as a temporary workaround for an SDL bug on the
  Linux platform.
+ Added PlayStation Portable (PSP) port. This code was written
  by Exophase and is highly experimental. It may not work at
  all for you. Please see docs/build.txt for more information
  regarding this port.
+ Fixed mouse movement from being affected by height_multiplier
  when not in fullscreen mode.
+ Fixed height_multiplier config.txt option allowing you to
  enter really stupid values (like negatives, 0, and values too
  large for the resolution).
+ Added in an extra video mode check to stop MZX from crashing
  on video modes that the video card can not reproduce.
+ Fixed Avalanche to a constant placement rate of 1/18 (this
  caused MZX to deliver an uneven number of boulders, and to
  crash with certain board sizes).
+ Fixed sprite collision box to stop MZX from crashing when
  stupid values are entered.
+ Fixed setting the viewport size to weird values like some old
  MZX games do.
+ Default fullscreen resolution is now 640x480; this can be
  changed in config.txt .
+ The config.txt option force_32bpp is now enabled by default.
+ Seeking with mod_position when using a .WAV file as
  background music fixed (thanks Mr_Alert).
- Removed ability to change SMZX mode ingame (F11).

December 10, 2006 - MZX 2.81d

NOTE: This release was made by Alistair Strachan (ajs) and not
      by Exophase. As such, any problems present in this
      release that were not present in 2.81c should be reported
      directly to ajs.

+ Fixed a compilation failure on Linux, due to SDL no longer
  depending on libX11. Now we manually link X11 into MZX if
  necessary.
+ Various build system improvements, fixing bugs in the
  prefixing of dependencies.
+ New libmodplug 0.8 imported, fixing many endian problems on
  big-endian machines, integrating all of our local patches to
  0.7.
+ Fixed bug causing MZX to freeze when starting up on Win9x
  machines.
+ Fixed a warning generated by GCC 4.1.
+ Updated the GPL boilerplates project-wide to the newest FSF
  address.
+ Fixed a string range check causing an obscure crash in
  certain games.
+ Updated the build.txt documentation.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

December 14, 2005 - MZX 2.81c

+ Oops, accidentally broke shift + F2. Fixed that.
+ Also accidentally broke &+counter& for full hex
  representation. Fixed.
+ Fixed memory leak problem with playing certain WAVs in a
  loop.
+ Fixed inconsistency of bad viewport sizes behaving
  differently on current versions from old DOS versions.
+ Accidentally broke joystick stuff in config.txt (has to do
  with way configure options were being read), fixed.
+ Fixed bug causing crash when loading MZBs larger than the
  current board size.
+ Made cursor hidden in alt + V in editor.
+ String comparison failed with nulls in the strings, fixed.
  Also should be slightly more optimal.
+ Fixed bug when using negative numbers for
  if sprite_colliding "counter".
+ Fixed math operations (inc, dec, etc) not working on string
  indeces. 
+ Added ability to force screen to 32bpp. Fixes some slight
  rendering issues, and if you have problems with fullscreen
  let me know if this helps (try it without first though). See
  force_32bpp in config.txt. 
+ Fixed sprite clipping bug with respect to overlay. 
+ Fixed bug where pressing enter on things besides robots,
  scrolls/signs, or sensors in the editor would clear whatever
  was underneath it. 
+ Accidentally broke SFX with optional PC speaker chains
  (played both, should only play PC speaker when digital music
  is off, fixes Bernard the Bard).
+ Made last character in char selection for F3 and alt + C
  remembered (note that they're remembered in two different
  places for both).
+ Accidentally broke life animations, fixed.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

November 26, 2005 - MZX 2.81b

+ Fixed inability to make proper .savs of worlds with strings.
  (they'd crash when loaded..)
+ Fixed PC speaker audio bug causing a constant high pitched
  noise to be played instead of PC speaker audio sometimes.
+ Fixed some issues with long pathnames.
+ Fixed a bug causing Caverns to crash in recent versions (long
  story, it was most likely due to an error in ver1to2).
+ Now when you set mzx_speed in a game you can no longer change
  the speed from the F2 menu. Setting mzx_speed to 0 reallows
  this (and doesn't set the speed).
+ When loading a game its speed is now set to the speed MZX
  started with (whatever's in config.txt, or the default of 4).
+ Added backup_ext config.txt option to specify the extension
  of backup files (default is .mzx).
+ Fixed backup_interval for config.txt possibly being broken.
+ Fixed a bug messing up the death board on some old MZX games
  (like Nick Brick 2)
+ Escaped more things and made displays always in escaped form
  for certain character sequences. It should be impossible to
  type non-escaped forms. The following should be used:
  \0 for 0 (this probably won't work in strings, but in chars
  should)
  \t for tab (character 9)
  \n for newline (character 10)
  \r for carriage return (character 13)
  \" for double quote
  \\ for slash
+ Copy + paste on escaped character won't unescape them
  anymore.
+ Fixed error message for invalid lines in Robotic.
+ Fixed inability to import text files from other directories.
+ Huge overhaul of the source (proper types for things,
  directions, equalities, conditions, chest items, and
  potions), if anything is suddenly broken now let me know.
+ Made scrolls/signs only display text (letters, numbers, etc).
  in the default char set. That should be enough for now.
+ Added mousewheel support for robot editor and robot box
  display.
+ Fixed inability to load MZMs from other directories in the
  editor.
+ Wrapped audio stuff in proper mutex, hopefully this fixes
  some issues (like crashing when changing mod_frequency a
  lot).
+ Long current directory paths no longer write out too much in
  the file loader (instead the last bit is shown with a ...
  prefixing the beginning)
+ Decided to be nice and make board_scan not crash. Don't use
  it. It's only there to make one legacy game work. If you use
  it I will personally scold you. And don't tell other people
  to use it (that means you CJA). Use
  copy block x y w h "$str" t
  instead. If you don't know what that means read the help
  file, it explains everything.
+ Removed ability to copy + paste after changing board
  dimensions of the source under any circumstances (alt + R,
  alt + Z, import world, import board).
+ Fixed appearance of ghosts in F10 menu.
+ Prevented char editor from counting moving the cursor as an
  undo step if nothing was actually drawn.
+ Made pressing escape on initial char selection/board
  selection/param selection for things cause it to cancel
  placing anything.
+ Made it impossible to set board width/height to 0 again
  (oops).
+ Made starting lives and starting health take effect
  immediately for the first alt + t.
+ Added ability to play OGG from alt + l (but not the other
  mods, don't want to clutter that up).
+ Made it so if no note follows an embedded SAM in a play
  string it's played at native frequency.
+ Accidentally made loading worlds in the editor not change the
  current directory, fixed that.
  
<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

November 20, 2005 - MZX 2.81

+ Fixed a bug where MZX world/save names > 12 chars could cause
  weird things to happen (like doors breaking).
+ Fixed problems with help file/charsets loading when loading
  MZX outside of the directory MZX is in. This should fix file
  associations on Windows as well.
+ Changed board selector so when board 0 is "(no board)" it
  doesn't actually refer to the title but to no board.
+ Made import world not overwrite the title string.
+ Fixed bug that causes crash when trying to flood fill an area
  with the color it already is in the SMZX char editor.
+ Redid audio engine. Everything is unified now, meaning that
  anything you can use as a mod you can use as a sam and
  vice-versa.
+ The new audio engine uses its own master resampler that has
  three interpolation modes - see config.txt for more
  information.
+ sam 0 filename will play a file at its native frequency (note
  that SAMs that have been converted from WAVs are set to be
  played at 8363Hz).
+ Added support for OGG vorbis audio files.
+ Fixed bug causing SFX volume control in F2 menu to not work.
+ Removed limitation on number of SAMs that can be played
  simultaneously.
+ Fixed bug where the mouse got "stuck" in the black border
  edges of non 640x350 fullscreen resolutions.
+ Fixed issues with message boxes being part default palette
  part current palette, they now always use the current
  palette.
+ Added mod_position counter. What these actually set/return is
  dependant on the type of file loaded. Modules use the current
  row, OGGs use the current PCM sample.
+ Added mod_frequency counter. There are a few things to note
  here: Modules have a "nominal" frequency of 44.1KHz. Other
  data types have their own nominal frequency to prevent output
  from sounding differently depending on the audio_sample_rate
  in config.txt. For OGGs and WAVs the nominal frequency is the
  one the file is encoded at. Changing the frequency can cause
  a noticeable one time popping sound, so it might not be
  desirable to slide it. This is much more prominent with
  lowering the frequency than raising it. This value is capped
  so it can't reach below 16.
+ Changed alt + L to play back at natural frequency instead of
  8363Hz.
+ Fixed bug causing sensor deletion while the player is on top
  to destroy the player.
+ Fixed bug causing imported boards to possibly crash after
  being tested.
+ Fixed bug causing save_game and save_world to not work if a
  file with the given name isn't already present.
+ Changed function counter matching removing restriction on
  number of digits for parameters. 10+ digit inputs should no
  longer fail (for instance, abs-123456789)
+ Made counter/string names internally variable length instead
  of a fixed 14 chars. There is now no longer a name length
  limitation.
+ Changed alt+8 for mod * to just * in the hotkey listing.
+ Fixed crash when referencing (by param) sprites > 256.
+ The string system has been redone. Strings are now
  dynamically sized and don't have an artificial maximum
  length. Writing to string.N will guarantee that the size of
  the string becomes at least N, while reading in this way will
  return 0 if out of bounds to maintain the illusion of null
  termination. Be careful when using this.
+ $str.length returns the length of string $str (this is faster
  than iterating through it to find when chars hit 0).
+ Vlayer is dynamically sized. The vlayer_width/vlayer_height
  counters still work as per usual, but the vlayer_size counter
  has been added to adjust the maximum size. The default is
  32768.
+ Fixed bug not allowing things to move over goop.
+ Fixed bugs causing current directory to be changed when
  importing things from other directories.
+ Properly implemented support for volume "string".
+ Fixed a few commands not working when they should from the
  global robot (such as put to dir of player).
+ Fixed a bug where going to a label at the end of a robot
  would treat it as if it's the first of its name in a sequence
  of labels.
+ Fixed a bug involving moving the a block with the player not
  moving what was underneath the player.
+ New help file, thanks MUCHLY to Terryn for pulling off this
  enormous effort! (This is what you're reading from.)
- Save files from 2.80 are not compatible due to several
  changes in the save format.

June 6, 2005 - MZX 2.80h

+ Fixed a bug which could cause crashes when quitting the game.
+ Fixed some bugs when changing boards and other things that
  can cause duplicate players.. I think.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when adding boards.
+ Improved response time in editor for slower computers/high
  load situations.
+ Fixed some endian issues with the GUI.
+ Fixed some crash when moving the mouse cursor around in the
  editor.
+ Fixed bug where you if you had a robot whose name is the same
  as the global robot it wouldn't get messages (fixes yoyo in
  Weirdness).
+ Fixed debug box not moving with text input.
+ Fixed bug with duplicate player appearing when killed and a
  new one can't be put at 0, 0.
+ Added copy/paste for outside of MZX to/from the robot editor.
  It only works in Windows and X11, and functionality may be
  limited in X11 right now (currently seems to work in native
  X11 apps and GTK 2.6 apps but not earlier GTK or QT, also try
  shift + insert to paste).
+ Fixed bug in resizing involving overlay blanking.
+ Fixed clear messages/projectiles not working (and damaging
  the game instead).
+ Fixed behavior of P key in editor for wildweasel.
+ Fixed random in Robotic not correctly swapping the range if
  they're given in the wrong order.
+ Fixed clip length in [ messages.
+ Fixed crash when changing volume without a game loaded.
+ Redid internal GUI system, fixes some minor things.
+ New file loading/saving window - press del to delete a
  file/dir, alt + n to create a new directory, alt + r to
  rename a file/dir.
+ Added PC speaker volume control to F2 settings and
  config.txt.
+ Fixed yet another crash bug with resizing boards.
+ Fixed inability to type * in text placement in the editor
  (although this adds inability to turn on mod * while F2 is
  on...).
+ Added ctrl + n in the editor to load a module for listening
  only (won't set the current board's module, and will let you
  choose ones from different directories).
+ Fixed crash on macros with more variables than can be
  displayed in their configuration.
+ Fixed bug that causes char selection cursor to reset to 0 on
  unhandled keys (and continuously do so for lock keys).
+ Tweaked ctrl + dir in text entry boxes.
+ Added gdm2s3m in-tree to the contrib/ directory. gdm2s3m no
  longer needs to be installed on the system before compiling
  mzx.
+ Improved the build system to automatically build .c and .cpp
  files with compound system CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, respectively.
+ Made package.sh automatically ship the source package with a
  Makefile.dist to warn the user that they need to run
  config.sh before 'make'.
+ Rectified inconsistency in source copyrights.
+ Added multi-character editor. Select multiple keys in the
  character selection with shift. The char editor also now has
  the ability to perform operations (delete, copy, scroll, etc)
  on subblocks. Hold down shift or press alt + b to highlight a
  region (press escape to remove the latter). Blocks copied
  like this will be pasted to where the cursor is at. Other
  small things in chareditor tweaked/changed... No longer press
  tab to toggle through set/clear/toggle draw modes, instead
  tab for set mode and shift + tab for clear (no more toggle).
  Mouse behavior is modified as well. In non-SMZX left click
  sets, right click clears. Shift + F2 will cut a block (clear
  + copy).

  alt + x/alt + i can now be used to import/export partial
  charsets while in the char editor. You can do so for several
  in series: put a # in the name of the charset then set the
  First for the first number # will be replaced with and the
  Count value to indicate how many in series to work with. For
  instance, saving s#.chr with first = 0, count = 3, starting
  at offset 100, with a 2x2 char selection will save charsets
  s0.chr from 100, s1.chr from 104, s2.chr from 108, and
  s3.chr from 112.

  *** NOTE *** Series import/export will only work correctly
  with char selections that are one in height (they can still
  be split up another way in the editor itself). If you want to
  use partial charsets on your edits, it's important that you
  select all the chars in a row.

+ Made characters for the editor/GUI use another charset that's
  protected. Please notify me if any characters are incorrect.
  Modify mzx_edit.chr to change this charset. The same thing
  goes for colors. It doesn't work for SMZX, which also might
  look a bit different in the editor...
+ Added option (defaults on) to protect chars 32-127 in input
  boxes and strings in the robot editor.
+ Mouse warping goes to middle instead of top corner now, so
  there isn't a bias towards moving up.
+ Hopefully fixed another bug with the cursor and changing
  boards...
+ Fixed module looping problem in modplug...
+ Added libmodplug 0.7 with both patches (see contrib/)
  in-tree. Removes system dependency on libmodplug.
+ Made auto-backup on by default. (3 count)
+ Made if touching idle, beneath always false instead of like
  nodir.
+ Fixed bug that caused bad things to happen if you pressed too
  many different keys too rapidly.
+ Made mouse wheel emulate up/down in dialog boxes and list
  menu.
+ Added ctrl + backspace to intake (delete previous word).
+ Made modulo operator use floored instead of truncated mod
  (uses positive remainder instead of negative).
+ Fixed crash when testing after using ctrl + z to clear a
  board.
+ Fixed bug where sending other robots to subroutines caused
  the return address to be to the next instruction like local
  subroutine calling works.
+ Fixed bug where going to a label on the last line of the
  robot could screw the game up.
+ Fixed a bug where the editor froze if you tried to fill the
  board with players. (eheh...)
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when sending all sensors
  something.
+ Fixed some crashes when exporting/saving fails.
+ Fixed import world's ability to go over the board limit and
  cause crashes.
+ Allowed input of decimal numbers for params.

April 1, 2005 - MZX 2.80g

+ Fixed crash on alt + x in robot editor.
+ Fixed missing line on alt + h in robot editor.
+ Introduced incorrect enter action in robot editor (didn't
  reset to beginning of the line), fixed.
+ Fixed garbage appearing when moving from a larger to smaller
  board and being outside of that board's scroll region.
+ Fixed bug that could cause glitches/crashing when resizing
  the board.
+ Fixed error with global next option not retaining the three
  checkmark options correctly.
+ Added work around so that move block moves the player (won't
  move it on inter-board moves).
+ Fixed bad palette loading for Linux introduced in 2.80e or f
  or something
+ Made it so block highlighting doesn't highlight the debug
  window.
+ Made the debug window move if necessary when home/end is
  pressed.
+ Added autorepeat buffering so previous keys can be resumed.
+ Fixed bug with swap world possibly not working (crashing??)
  off Windows.
+ Fixed more problems with garbage/crashes when resizing with
  the cursor in a position causing the scroll to go off the
  edge.
+ Fixed incorrect text cursor offset with
  force_height_multiplier on.
+ Redid way directories are loaded internally so you can load
  dirs with over 4096 entries now. Might be faster (unsure)
+ Chest contents list menu looked funny, fixed.
+ Changed default.spl to smzx.pal so you can load it more
  sanely.
+ Export block wasn't getting the last selected line. Fixed.
+ Hacked scroll editor so it wouldn't crash when removing
  lines. Scroll code either needs to be 100% overhauled or
  replaced by robots somehow...
+ Fixed config files not being closed.
+ Added include file option for config files. Use it like this:
  include "config file"; e.g., "include subconfig.cnf" will
  load subconfig.cnf's options.
+ Fixed freadN not terminating strings.
+ Fixed graphical glitch when using the mouse in the char
  selector.
+ Fixed save games crashing when they can't load fopened files.
+ Fixed some other problems with save games and fopened files.
+ Accidentally had title screen running a bit slow...
+ Value strings starting with ( not parsed as an expression if
  they don't end with the ).
+ Fixed problem with key_code being triggered for keys that
  aren't in-game.
+ Added extended macros. This allows for parameter based macros
  to be entered in the robot editor via a window or by command.
  See macro.txt for more information.
+ Fixed player cloning after flip/mirror and player placing.
+ Added random seeding that was mysteriously missing...
+ Finally added drive changing for Windows builds.
+ Fixed mousex/mousey for resolutions other than 640x350 (only
  applies to fullscreen).
+ Fixed crash on weird invalid death/endgame boards...
+ % and & messages clip correctly now.
+ Fixed potential crash on double closing the files.
+ Fixed crash bugs with placing sensors and maybe scrolls.
+ Fixed sending sensors when you have robots of the same name
  (fixes Weirdness chapter 1).
- Removed the unimplemented if player dir and if not player dir
  commands from RASM.
  
<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

December 26, 2004 - MZX 2.80f

+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when auto-quoting params
  in the robot editor (eg, set x 1 -> set "x" to 1).
+ Fixed a bug that could crash the robot editor if you added a
  new line prior to the first line of a marked block, then did
  an action on it.
+ Fixed a bug where clearing the first and only line could
  cause it to appear as if it hadn't been cleared at all.
+ Unified global and global next parameter setting so that
  nothing is lost between first/next but information can be
  cancelled without application.
+ Fixed E/S block markers appearing in the robot editor when
  they should be off the screen.
+ Left click position in robot editor mysteriously disappeared
  after having been added somewhere after 2.80d. Re-added.
+ Added option to hide the hotkeys help and horizontal border
  in the robot editor with alt + h. Also added a config.txt
  option to have it default this way.
+ Search/replace in the robot editor. ctrl + f to find or
  replace/replace all, ctrl + r to repeat either search or
  replace (depending the last one you did, if you cancelled
  this does nothing).
+ The load_game counter sequence was broken; fixed.
+ Hopefully fixed all means of overrunning the current line max
  length in the robot editor...
+ Fixed robot editor validation not showing every 13th line.
+ Fixed aesthetic problem with validation report...
+ Fixed crash with setting message column less than 0.
+ A couple things added for 2.80e mysteriously disappeared in
  source handling. Re-added.
+ Changed max board size prevention to auto resize the lower
  dimension to the max that can be handled with the higher
  (ex, 30000x25000 becomes 30000x559).
+ Added flood fill to char editors (alt + f).
+ Added single depth undo to char editors (alt + u).

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

December 19, 2004 - MZX 2.80e

+ Fixed a bug causing problems with static overlay if a
  non-overlaid sprite is displayed so it's clipped off the edge
  of the screen.
+ Fixed a bug in the display of c?x color boxes in the F2 menu
  in the robot editor.
+ Fixed a bug that caused incorrect thisx/thisy for one cycle
  after copyblock.
+ Fixed a bug preventing calls to nonexistent subroutines from
  passing that point in the robot.
+ Fixed crash on sam 0 "file".
+ Fixed a bug where loading new SFX may not correctly overwrite
  previous ones.
+ Fixed a bug where you could only load/unload so many mods
  before MZX couldn't load anymore.. same bug as the SAMs but
  went unnoticed!
+ Fixed a bug that caused you to be infinitely stuck in the
  global settings dialog box when you press previous on the
  next page.
+ Fixed a bug where going to next then exiting would not save
  the changes from the previous page.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause crashes while ending modules.
+ Fixed a bug that could do the same kind of thing with sams.
+ Fixed an allocation bug when loading MZX worlds that could
  lead to crashes.
+ Fixed a bug that caused MZX to crash if you interpolated an
  expression with a value equal to or greater than 1 billion.
+ Fixed a bug where mixing ccheck1/2 with sprites from board
  and vlayer could cause problems (that's the short version of
  the explanation, I'll spare you the long one).
+ Fixed a bug that could cause certain old MZX games to crash
  after the title screen
+ Somewhere broke missiles between 2.80c and 2.80d. Fixed.
+ Fixed error in lit bomb anim sequence setup in char ID
  editor.
+ Reworked a lot of robot editor code; adding/deleting lines
  while marked areas are active should work more naturally now
  and it's hopefully no longer possible to crash it in the same
  ways it was previously.
+ Fixed crash when setting mesg row to less than 0.
+ Fixed mouse presses not working in the robot editor.
+ Made MZX ignore alt + tab so you can safely switch in your WM
  without it triggering...
+ Added numerical key entry for number boxes. Use 0-9 to add to
  the most significant digit and backspace to take it away.
+ Added config.txt option to make MZX pause when key focus is
  lost (when clicking on another window, perhaps) or when it's
  minimized. Music will still continue.
+ Added save/load position to the editor. Works for loads
  in between boards as well. Press ctrl + num to save to slots
  0 through 9 and alt + num to load from that slot. Please
  press shift + 8 or the numpad * key instead of alt + 8 to set
  mod wildcard.
+ Fixed a further bug that could cause playing samples to
  crash.
+ Added config file option to revert the robot editor to the
  default palette when loaded.
+ Fixed bug in shoot command.
+ Fixed error when making save name in editor but cancelling.
+ Auto-backup - see config.txt for details.
+ Joystick key mapping - see config.txt for details.
+ You can now load game-specific config files by creating
  game.cnf for the corresponding game.cnf (for instance,
  caverns.cnf). This is mainly useful for joystick key mapping.
  Note that these settings will NOT go away if another game is
  loaded that doesn't have a .cnf.
+ Alt+enter finally works as block action in the robot editor.
+ Loading a .mzx/.sav from another directory indirectly (via
  command-line or robotic) will now actually change the current
  working directory.
+ Fixed bug that crashed MZX with ctrl + i in the robot editor.
- Fixed maximum board size to about 16.7 million tiles (128MB)
  for now.
- MZX now ignores the mouse scroll wheel instead of
  interpreting it as a click.

October 9, 2004 - MZX 2.80d

+ Fixed cursor going invisible when escaping from import in the
  editor.
+ Fixed robot editor entry when pressing OK on global info.
+ Fixed lack of name for MZB import/export (any MZB's exported
  in prior beta versions still won't have a name).
+ Fixed some problems with setting the mouse position.
+ Fixed problem with exits not bringing you all the way to the
  edge if width over 400 or height over 200.
+ Fixed bug that cleared too much when increasing both width
  and height while resizing the board.
+ Fixed problem with 1 char shortcut commands with spaces
  immediately after them.
+ Fixed problems with load_robot and load_bc (caused crashes
  and infinite loops).
+ Optimized RASM heavily (this should be most noticeable when
  doing a lot of external robot loading from text files).
+ Fixed inability to use absolute paths in loading a game from
  command line.
+ Fixed lastshot/lasttouch conditions with directions not
  working.
+ Fixed char editor in robots not going into SMZX mode when
  proper.
+ Cleaned up source code so it passes -Wall without complaint
  and in the process corrected some glaring code errors that
  may have corrected random problems.
+ File opening broken in 2.80c, fixed.
+ Implemented MZM2 saving and loading and rewrote mzm.cpp (if
  anything is changed or fixed regarding MZMs, attribute it to
  this). MZM2s can be of larger dimensions, smaller filesize
  for same amount of data, and can store robots.
+ Fixed bug that could cause MZX to crash when making new
  strings.
+ Block operations to overlay when overlay was off caused
  crashes - fixed.
+ Fixed a problem with sprite ccheck2 against other sprites.
+ Optimized function counter lookups a bit; speed gain for all
  counter accesses (especially ones that begin with certain
  characters such as _).
+ Fixed disassembly error with ' ' character.
+ Fixed assembly error where condition extended dir (such as
  blocked opp seek) was not getting compiled with the dir
  extension.
+ Fixed editor bug where the param was not being cleared when
  overwriting things by double placement.
+ Fixed inability to use counters with
  playercolor/bulletcolor/missilecolor.
+ Added ability to use counters in place of p?? in the robot
  editor. Note - even though this expands functionality of the
  editor this does not require a version number change because
  the worlds will still be playable in older MZX versions (and
  will display correctly in the robot editor - you simply won't
  be able to correctly edit the commands).
+ Mouse correctly limited to screen edges now.
+ Fixed inability to overwrite robots with pushable robots and
  vice-versa, as well as scrolls with signs and vice-versa.
+ Possibly fixed problem with windowing error when editing
  global robot (?).
+ Fixed disappearing cursor after color selection box with
  mouse (and other places?).
+ Fixed bug in sprite clipping that caused some to be clipped
  off inappropriately.
+ Made board_id/board_param counters readable.
+ Added bound checks for all counters using
  board_x/board_y/overlay_x/overlay_y.
+ Fixed potential direction corruption bug causing directions
  not to work sometimes even if they display correctly in the
  robot editor.
+ Fixed copy overlay to MZM copying to overlay too.
+ Fixed a bug where debug window could display the wrong amount
  of robot mem and potentially even crash MZX.
+ Fixed help_menu counter not doing anything (durr).
+ Changed sprite draw order so they're drawn underneath the
  message bar, debug box, and time remaining display.
+ Changed put p?? in Robotic so it will put default params if
  available.
+ Fixed a bug that could cause copies from overlay to vlayer to
  not end up at the correct destination.
+ Fixed a bug where c?x and cx? would not display correctly in
  the robot editor.
+ Optimized copy blocks a bit using variable length arrays
  instead of malloc.
- Removed ability to put robots, scrolls/signs, and sensors
  (with the put command in Robotic).
  
<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

August 16, 2004 - MZX 2.80c
+ Fixed issues with the commands counter not being reset.
+ Color intensity now gets reset when you enter the editor
+ SAMs got cut off sometimes now.. fixed.
+ Fixed bug where loading a world with empty boards could
  change the starting, endgame, and death boards.
+ Fixed bug where you could text enter off the bottom of the
  board, causing problems.
+ Fixed bug involving cutting/clearing the entire robot in the
  robot editor while not at the first line.
+ Fixed robot name entry for global robot not disappearing on
  small boards.
+ Fixed bug where you could duplicate the player by holding
  down a direction as a saved game loads.
+ Fixed bug where you could go to line 0 in the robot editor.
+ Saving an MZM now auto-adds the .mzm extension...
+ Fixed black screen on quicksave.
+ Fixed bug where opening a file didn't close the old one if
  one was open (so it'd eventually crash MZX).
+ Changed Alt+backspace behavior in intake so it doesn't exit.
+ Added clipping for refx/refy/width/height for sprites (less
  than 0 at initialization, greater than board width/height at
  draw).
+ Fixed direction parsing for move all.
+ Fixed bug where creating things on top of the player would
  use a slot for robots/scrolls/signs/sensors instead of just
  copy to the buffer.
+ Added ability to use chars as immediates in Robotic commands
  (ie, set "$str.0" 'a').
+ Added options to enable oversampling and specify resampling
  mode in the config file (higher quality audio).
+ Building with patched modplug that fixes loading 2-channel
  mods outputted by FT2. If you're building yourself, see
  build.txt.
+ Fixed inability to mouse click in alt + h mode.
+ Fixed ability to mouse click outside of board range.
+ Should work better for Linux users; case insensitivity for
  file opens has been added.
+ Fixed close bug that was affecting Linux builds (may affect
  more).
+ Keypad enter works where normal enter works now.
+ Fixed disappearing cursor when cancelling out of abandon
  changes box when loading a new world in the editor.
+ Fixed problems when loading/saving robots outside of ID range
  (do not hardcode ID's people).
+ Fixed problem with NO BOARD exits being set to something else
  when empty boards were being stripped or when worlds were
  being imported.
+ Fixed bug where auto-decrypting worlds didn't work if the XOR
  value was negative.
+ Fixed problem with rid not working the first cycle.
+ Fixed inability to interpolate (with &&'s) counter names
  larger than 14.
+ Added new robot mem counter in debug box (only kb precise,
  rounds up).
+ Fixed ability to clone the player on non-title board after
  testing.
+ Lengthened size of mod name buffers.
+ Fixed bug where send x y doesn't work from the global robot.
+ Fixed a few bugs that could cause MZX to crash.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

August 11, 2004 - MZX 2.80b

+ Made it possible for robots to move through teleporters.
+ Fixed bug with pressing shift in text entry boxes.
+ Made it so alt + tab does not switch draw modes in editor.
+ Fixed a disassembly error for color intensity N percent
  command.
+ Fixed problem with looping on mods that do not loop
  explicitly.
+ Fixed alt + dir scrolling in the char editor.
+ Fixed not being able to click the rightmost char in the char
  editor.
+ Re-added unmark (alt + u) to robot editor (mysteriously
  disappeared??).
+ Fixed key label so it returns proper unicode values.
+ The player and pushable robots can now be pushed by the push
  command.
+ Fixed bug where you could clone the player by switching
  boards.
+ Fixed bug where you could either turn off overlay or switch
  to boards that don't have it while in overlay edit mode...
+ Fixed bug where remains of debug window would not be cleared
  in editor if the board width is too small.
+ Fixed bug where turning off the menu with a board too small
  would mess things up.
+ Fixed bug where run lengths were saved one too large... this
  could fix stability problems in at least occasional cases
  (with saved worlds or save games, at least).
+ Fixed placing solid things beneath robots (like bombs).
+ Added support for a keyboard plus in the char editors.
+ Fixed previous button in SFX editor.
+ Made robot name box disappear when robot char box comes up...
+ Fixed bug where mods restart after pressing P if they're the
  same mod as what was playing before.
+ Fixed problem with changing params (with P) in the editor.
+ Fixed bug where null boards were not being pruned from old
  worlds upon load.
+ Made file name saving box larger (for saving games and
  worlds).
+ Fixed bug where default (100%) palette intensity values would
  not be applied to the palette a game loads with.
+ Fixed bug where exporting char sets that are full size caused
  a 0 byte charset to be exported (8bit wraparound).
+ Added support for forms such as :line.
+ Fixed sporadic incompletion of strings without trailing
  quotes at the end of the line.
+ Fixed bug where clearing/cutting the last line of a robot
  crashed MZX.
+ F4 in robot editor now works more generally.
+ Made line numbers in robot editor error report start at 1.
+ Added ctrl + G to go to a line in the robot editor (ala
  nano).
+ Made it possible to change a robot's color in the editor
+ Fixed bug where spitfire, seekers, and missiles didn't hurt
  something immediate adjacent to whatever shot it.
+ Fixed editing of spitfires.
+ Made default speed 4 again (5, bleh).
+ Re-added quicksave/quickload.
+ Re-added F8 clear (always works - be careful).
+ Fixed autorepeat problems for spacepressed/delpressed.
+ Wrapped around sprite values so LogiCow's bad code would work
  (HTMCIAB).
+ Cleared block commands in between board changing and other
  things like that.
+ Fixed bug where MZX would crash if put dir player overwrote
  the robot doing it.
+ Fixed bug where playing SAMs would eventually crash MZX
+ Fixed some mod * problems (hopefully?).
+ Fixed bug where pasting blocks over the edge of the board in
  the editor would cause MZX to crash.
+ Uses new GDM2S3M source that fixes some bugs. If your
  converted GDM's have problems, delete the S3Ms it generated.
- Removed export text in the board editor. Don't think anyone
  wanted it...
  
<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

August 9, 2004 - First release, MZX 2.80 BETA

+ All ASM files have been rewritten to ANSI C compliant C++;
  this mainly involves the mammoth game2.asm.
+ Everything graphics related has been replaced with an SDL
  driven engine, including text mode rendering (also capable of
  rendering SMZX modes).
+ All keyboard and mouse events are now also handled by an SDL
  driven engine. All internal keyboard/mouse routines use SDL
  keycodes; no attempt was made to convert to MZX's old format
  at this level.
+ All world/board/robot loading and saving code has been
  entirely rewritten and is more modular now.
+ All robot handling code has been rewritten from scratch, and
  is more sane/efficient now (allocation, message sending,
  sensors, etc.)
+ All counter handling code has also been rewritten from
  scratch. This includes the functionality of builtin and
  "function" counters. It also includes a new string framework.
+ The robot interpreter has been almost entirely rewritten.
+ The main game playing code (game.cpp) has been almost
  entirely rewritten.
+ All module/sample playing code has been rewritten to use
  modplug and SDL. PC speaker effects are emulated.
+ The main part of the editor (edit.cpp) has been almost
  entirely rewritten.
+ The robot editor has been entirely rewritten, utilizing a
  modified (fixed) version of RASM (released by me over a year
  ago)
+ All other source files (for instance, window handling code,
  scroll displaying, char editor, etc.) have been largely
  overhauled, some to more of a degree than others. At the
  very least, everything has been reformatted and made to work
  with the new systems.
+ key_pressed and key_code now return unsigned chars instead of
  signed, so if the game checks for negative values, it won't
  work. The same goes for reading back characters for strings.
+ Boards may now be as large as 32767x32767. Please do not make
  boards this large. :)
+ You may now have up to 250 boards.
+ Boards may have up to 255 robots, 255 scrolls, and 255
  sensors.
+ There is no robot memory per board limit. However, individual
  robots may only be up to 64k large. If you include the global
  robot, this means that you effectively can have up to 16MB of
  robot memory per board.
+ The same applies to scrolls, which have separate memory
  spaces and may only be up to 64k in length each (so you could
  have almost 16MB of scroll text per board, but who would want
  that??).
+ The robot stack need not be initialized, and will be
  dynamically resized as necessary (useful for recursion). This
  refers to lines such as
  . "#*-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8"
  at the beginning of robots. They're no longer necessary or
  useful (they will be ignored, like any other comment).
+ You may have a virtually unlimited number of counters active.
  The theoretical limit is some 4 billion. The effective limit
  depends on memory available.
+ The same goes for strings, which may now have any name, so
  long as it begins with a dollar sign ($). The same
  conventions regarding strings in 2.68+ still apply (see
  268_info.txt for more information).
+ Local2 and local3 no longer have dangerous side-effects.
  Local4 through local32 are also available per-robot now.
+ The following are now natively supported: XM, S3M, MOD, MED,
  MTM, STM, IT, 669, ULT, WAV, DSM, FAR, AMS, MDL, OKT, DMF,
  PTM, DBM, AMF, MT2, PSM, J2B, and UMX.
+ You can now perform repeated copies by selecting "Copy
  (repeated)" from the block command window. This will cause
  you to repeat the copy indefinitely until you press escape.
  Also, after the first paste is made, you may press ctrl +
  direction to move in steps that are the size of the copy (you
  really have to try it to get a good idea of what I mean).
+ Press alt + H to hide/unhide the menu/information occupying
  the bottom 6 lines of the screen.
+ Right click is similar to pressing insert (grabs whatever's
  under the cursor).
+ Exporting char sets now gives direct options to set the
  size/offset for partial charsets. The old format (prefixing
  the name) will not work.
+ For saving files, you may make filenames larger and use mixed
  case (as opposed to all caps).
+ Now when you import worlds their exits will actually work.
+ Loading worlds results in all empty boards and empty
  robots/scrolls/sensors within the boards being removed. When
  you delete a board, you won't be presented with a gap in the
  board list anymore.
+ You may once again select ASCII as a default charset and
  revert to it in the char editor. You may also select a
  default SMZX charset.
+ Anywhere you can enter a line of text you can now press ctrl
  + left and ctrl + right to go to the previous/next word.
+ This isn't totally limited to the editor, but now everywhere
  a selection box shows up (such as for files, boards, items)
  you can press multiple keys to seek to a specific entry.
  Furthermore, in file selection boxes you can press backspace
  to go up a directory.
+ The SMZX char editor has been changed quite a bit. First, to
  use, you must be in SMZX modes 1-3 (toggle using F11). Within
  the editor, press keys 1 through 4 to change the "current
  color." You can place this color with space, and you can
  toggle repeated placement on/off using tab (sorry, no
  clear/toggle in this mode, they got in the way far more than
  they helped). You now move in increments of 1 char naturally
  instead of "half chars." Right click grabs the current
  "color" underneath the cursor.
+ You are now able to type invalid code within a robotic line.
  You will see that it's invalid due to the way the line is
  color coded. If you try to escape while any lines are invalid
  or if you press alt + V, a window will be brought up
  describing the nature of all erroneous lines. It will also
  let you mark each line to be deleted or commented out on
  exit. If all invalid lines are marked with anything besides
  ignore, you can exit safely. You may also mark invalid lines
  using ctrl + I, D, and C (to mark as ignore, delete, and
  comment respectively). ctrl + C may also be used to comment
  out a normal line, and then uncomment.
+ alt + O is still available, but you may only change macros
  here (see the config file for the other rarely used options).
  This does give you more room to modify macros, though. They
  may be up to 64 characters in length, and you may set up to
  around 45 or so in this window. (To get larger, you'll have
  to use the config file.).
+ Command line params have changed.
+ MegaZeux configuration information is now stored in a file
  called config.txt.
- There are some slight discrepancies in robot size; if you
  highlight the last line then leave it, it will register as a
  compilation of that line. Yet, when you exit, the line will
  be discarded, so this addition is not permanent. This
  shouldn't be problematic.
- alt + enter and alt + escape no longer work; use the
  alternatives (alt + b and alt + u).
- You cannot click on help options to make it happen (for
  instance, you can't click on L:Load and expect it to bring up
  the load window).
- You cannot import or export ANS files. Use MZM instead.
- Some things that worked in the DOS version only worked due to
  chance, such as there being default (but valid) values for
  sprite widths or heights and thus sprites could be displayed
  before new values were set. They will not work here.

**NEW in 2.70***

+ Robotic code now loadable and savable to files, either to
  text files or compact but human-unreadable bytecode files.
  Other robots' code can be written to or read as well.
+ Defaults changed to more accepted values.
+ The swap world bug should be fixed. You should now be able to
  swap worlds back and forth with no trouble.
+ "atan" now works with any input/output value.
+ The "load_game" command now should work without any problems.
+ It should now be easier to compile MZX from the source.
+ It's not really a bug fix, but the palette is now returned to
  its original colors.
+ Robots can now 'put' things underneath themselves: eg. put
  c04 carpet p?? under.
+ The title screen menu now works: e.g. the menu you get when
  pressing 'Enter' on the title screen.
+ "key_pressed" now returns the twos-complement of the key
  value, i.e. the one used for :key?
+ The mouse can scroll across the whole screen after a screen
  refresh / transition to/from SMZX mode.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

**NEW in 2.69c***

+ Sprite limit expanded from 64 to 256.
+ New sprite flag added: sprN_ccheck mode 2.
+ Vlayer added.  This is a virtual, unseen layer 32767 in size
  used to store graphical data.
+ World loading and saving through Robotic now possible.
+ Special class fwrite_modify; this allows editing of a file as
  opposed to overwriting.
+ File end seeking added.
+ Char file offsetting added.
+ File seeking added to editor.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

***NEW in 2.69b***

+ Fixed the fwrite_append problem RoSS mentioned.
+ Fixed the string problem Nanobot mentioned.
+ Added ridNAME as an alternative to robot_id_NAME.
+ Added mouse_mx and mouse_my to determine mouse motion in
  "mickey" units.
+ Added two local counters "local2" and "local3", local2 uses
  walk_dir and is_locked (so walking and locking will affect
  it), local3 uses last_shot_dir and last_touch_dir (so
  shooting and being touched will affect it).
+ Added the builtin string "robot_name" to determine the name
  of the robot invoking it.
+ Reverted back to BWSB 1.20a again, in the hopes that it will
  alleviate swap world crashing a bit.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

***NEW in 2.69***

+ if "$stringN" = "literal" should now work.
+ Embedding && or () in names for save/load files for MZM
  saving and the like should work now.
+ Expressions won't be activated in pre-2.68 games, meaning if
  they used the constructs which would be valid expressions
  they should be okay.
+ More minutiae.
+ key_code, a more useful key_pressed alternative, added.
+ SMZX mode 1 returns.
+ SMZX mode 2 added.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

***NEW in 2.68***

+ Expressions added.
+ Trigonometric capabilities added.
+ MZM file capabilities added.
+ Board and overlay can now copy block to each other.
+ Saving and loading of SAV files through Robotic added.
+ String commands totally redone.
+ Now, instead of using value/sqrt_value/abs_value you may use
  a value with the counter directly as such:
   * sqrtN
   * absN
+ fread_pos/fwrite_pos and page should work correctly now; when
  you increase the pos it should bump up the page too.
+ pixel_x, pixel_y, char were broken in 2.65; fixed in 2.68
+ strings had some bugs in 2.62b+, should be fixed now because
  of a separate implementation.
+ MZX Robot files are now saved to save files, so if you have a
  read and/or write file open and the game is saved, if the
  game is loaded the file will be restored at the position it
  was at.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

***NEW in 2.65***

+ Shows current mod playing in debug window
+ Misc new counters: (ro = read only, wo = write only)
 * fread_counter (ro), fwrite_counter (wo): reads/writes a full
   counter from file
 * board_w (ro), board_h (ro): returns current board
   width/height
 * robot_id_(name) (ro): returns the ID number of robot "name"
 * r(number).(counter) (ro): returns the value of the local
   counter for the robot with the given ID. Note that you
   cannot write to another robot's counter.
+ You can now save partial charsets in the editor.
+ Sprites added; limit set at 64 global.
+ Counters now representable in hex.
+ Subroutines added.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

***NEW in 2.62***

+ Strings added; limited to ten strings.
+ "mod_order" counter: reports the current order (that is,
   pattern) the playing module is at. Used in conjunction with
   the jump mod order command it can be used to save/restore a
   mod position between boards...
- MZX 2.62 files are no longer forward compatible. That means
  that a file made in MZX 2.62 will NOT work in any previous
  versions (but it WILL work in future versions, so long as
  they set the version string correctly).
- The string reading from files may not work correctly on the
  first read (that is, it might truncate the first character of
  the string). For this reason put a junk string in the first
  part of the file and read it first.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

***NEW in 2.61***

+ Game speeds have been normalized.
+ Original startup color scheme implemented!
+ Redocumentation of a few features left undocumented.
- Password protection has been fully removed.

<a class="helplink" href="#SOUNDEFX.HLP__1st">MegaZeux's Sound System</a>

Note- This is a direct translation from the file WHATSNEW.251,

before, you probably won't understand much of this list.

<span class="fE ">New in version 2.51: (quick fix before I do 3.00!)</span>

 * Bug where moving north or west towards a board that is
  larger than 100 tiles in a dimension may not work properly
  fixed.
 * Bugs in 2GDM.EXE preventing proper conversion of some S3Ms
  fixed.
 * A rare bug preventing internal MOD conversion fixed.
 * "Error opening MOD" will no longer appear during normal
  gameplay.
 * Exporting ANSis now adds a color to the end returning text
  to normal grey.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<span class="fE ">New in version 2.50:</span>

 * FOR ALL YOU 2.07 USERS- THE MAJOR UPGRADE is the new sound
  code! Support for stereo, 16-bit, more cards, 4 sound
  effects channels, 32 music channels, higher quality, and
  faster sound code! Less bugs! More formats supported! All
  non-MOD files MUST be converted to GDM using the included
  2GDM.EXE program. Formats supported- MOD (up to 32 channels),
  WOW/OCT/NST, S3M, 669, and MTM.

 * Volume controls (overall and SAM) added to F2-Settings (saved
  in .CFG file)
 * SAMs play at 2x volume.
 * MTM support added to 2GDM.EXE. Other formats aren't added
  because they aren't needed (not used often enough) or in the
  case of XM, because they support too many advanced features
  that MZX does not support. Partial XM support MAY be added
  later.
 * Many minor bug fixes in 2GDM.EXE's conversion routines.
 * Internal MOD conversion (in MegaZeux) sped up considerably.
 * For all those that upgraded from 2.07, see 2.49g and 2.48b
  WHATS-NEW for more stuff, including a couple interesting
  new Robotic features

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<span class="fE ">New in version 2.49g:</span>

 * New Import function added- You can import an ANSi to any
  position on the board.
 * Full SAM sound effect support as in the original 2.07 version
  (but using the new MOD code for up to 4 simultaneous
  channels)
 * The OPEN Robotic command will now push the Robot out of the
  way if the door would be blocked by the robot.
 * REL PLAYER and REL COUNTERS now affects the THISX/THISY
  counters (giving the distance FROM the player/counters TO
  the Robot) and the prefixes also affect the IF [dir] BLOCKED
  command, allowing you to check for blocked status next to
  the player or an arbitrary position.
 * [ box message statements now clip their message to 64
  characters (the maximum) on display. Note that all other
  box-message statements are NOT clipped!
 * Color codes are allowed in ? and & box message statements
 * Invalid sound card settings no longer cause a lock-up
 * You can hold down the mouse button to cycle through RGB
  values in the palette editor
 * Changing something to an explosion no longer can cause weird
  colors
 * What's New section of help sorted by version
 * Placing a robot over the player is prevented with a warning
 * The "Alt+N- Music" lights up properly in the editor now
 * When changing from a larger board to a smaller board, you
  can no longer accidentally have the cursor outside of the
  board size.
 * GUS owners don't need to enter # of SFX channels, since
  MegaZeux cannot support GUS sound effects anyways.
 * File boxes (loading MODs, worlds, etc.) can now hold as
   many filenames as memory allows.
 * GUS setup shown properly on configuration screen
 * 2GDM.EXE rewritten- In THIS release, it can only convert
  MOD, NST, WOW, OCT, 669, and S3M files! The final (2.50)
  release will have support for the remaining file formats.
  It is being rewritten to fix many small bugs and make it
  smaller and faster, as well as possibly add more file
  formats.
 * 2GDM.EXE- F00 effect in MODs deleted during conversion
 * 2GDM.EXE- Bad effects S8x, S0x, and Xxx deleted during S3M
  conversion
 * 2GDM.EXE now works properly from other directories
 * INTERNAL MOD loading support. You can now load MODs, NSTs,
  WOWs, and OCTs from within the game without having to
  convert them to GDM first. The only exception is 15-
  instrument MODs- they must first be converted. Note that
  all other formats, such as S3M, 669, etc. must still be
  converted. NST/WOW/OCT support was only added because they
  are extremely similar to MODs, and MODs were required for
  backward compatibility.
 * Insert doesn't display those "Lo bomb selected" messages,
  etc. if the player is Attack Locked or settings say he
  cannot bomb.
 * Minor bugs in ANSi import corrected. (problem fixed- caused
  errors on import of ANSis with more or the same number of
  lines as the current board size maximum)
 * "Ammo <10" and "Ammo >9" entries in Global Chars changed to
  "Small Ammo" and "Large Ammo" to prevent confusion.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<span class="fE ">New in version 2.48b:</span>

 * ALL NEW music code! Features include faster, NO BUGs, 32
  channels, more formats supported (sorry, no MID or XM) etc.
 * Bug where selecting "(no board)" to add a board caused an
  error if that wasn't the first "(no board)" on the list.
 * Bug where if a robot line entered consisted of only
  semicolons, spaces, and commas, it would screw up that
  robot's program, fixed.
 * Command line options (-port,-dma,-irq) added for setting
  sound card parameters. Only needed if auto-detection fails.
 * Minor help corrections.
 * Save/load during testing in editor disabled.
 * Pressing \ no longer causes problems during gameplay.
 * Bug where "Restart board" for death option in global
  options didn't function properly on first board, nor did
  restart-if-zapped. (fixed)
 * Filling in the overlay no longer locks up if you fill over
  something of the same color and picture.
 * Overlay no longer messed up when resizing board.
 * Lock up on Import World removed.
 * Setting the counter "INVINCO" to 0 works properly.
 * Hopefully fixed rare lockups after robot box messages.
 * Added confirmation for board deletion in editor.
 * All included worlds are NO LONGER password protected. (The
  old password was "megahertz".)
 * Minor bugs in passage search algorithms corrected.
 * Obscure bug involving REL prefixes if used in "infinite-
  loop" type constructs (fixed)
 * In editor- Alt+Dir to move 10 spaces now works as expected
  with draw mode on. (IE it will draw in ALL 10 spaces)
 * Bug where passages on screens wider than 256 spaces didn't
  work properly. (fixed)
 * Bug where fire-to-player's-right would lock up and kill him
  FIXED.
 * Counters can be used in ALL strings in &COUNTER& notation.
  For example, SEND "ROBOT" "LABEL&COUNTER&" will replace
  &COUNTER& with a number. This works for ALL strings -
  counter names, labels, robots, etc. See Robotic help for
  details.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

<span class="fE ">New in version 2.07:</span>

 * Labels and NON-valid counter-regulated options in robot box
  messages are not blank lines; Instead they are just removed
  from the message.
 * Passage (stairs/caves/whirlpools) search algorithm
  corrected.
 * Digitized sample SFX works properly with the note B now.
 * Bug where getting multiple energizers in a row screwed up
  player's color is fixed.
 * Bug where chests with invinco potions will die when taken
  is fixed.
 * Filling in editor, with a robot/scroll/sensor over itself,
  is now handled properly.
 * Whee!! More minor help typos fixed.

<a class="helplink" href="#MAIN.HLP__072">Table of Contents</a>

 * Sending a robot a message, when it hadn't done anything yet
  that turn, activates it immediately. This helps with
  synchronized activities, such as large, multi-robot
  creatures.

  Alt+3 will no longer break to DOS)
 * Counters' code optimized.

  still jump to the start/end unless you are already there,
  then they will jump to the proper dialog location.

  used by global robot.

  (showing the little "freeing up board memory..." meter) then
  that robot stopped running.

  Putting a SPACE to it's NORTH) and then did a RANDNB or
  RANDB, the new surroundings weren't always taken into
  consideration.

  RANDNB and RANDB)

   SCROLLBASE COLOR, SCROLLBORDER COLOR, etc. (see help)
 * Removed Alt-Minus and Alt-Plus keys in editor- Useless and
   dangerous. (they were only for testing purposes.)
 * Various bug fixes
 * Joystick support- UNTESTED! Tony- I need feedback!
 * Mixing rate options at startup.
 * A warning is given and verification is necessary if you try
   to save a .MZX file over an already existing file.
 * You can now choose from some additional music output
   devices.
 * Help is in seperate files, MZX*.HLP, to save memory. (lots!)
 * I FINALLY THINK THE MEMORY AND FILE CODE WORKS PERFECT!
   Except for speed. Something to work on...
 * Char editor shows values of bytes along left side, for use
   with robot command CHAR EDIT.
 * Yet more help
 * Robot editor! See the top box for keys to use (Import/eXport
   not implemented yet)
 * Robots as well! See Help, Robo-P Reference, Command
   Reference, and look at commands for help using them. Some
   are not done yet.
 * Video mode returns to default VGA mode (text 16x9) on exit
 * File lists sorted
 * Directory support and DRIVE support in file boxes WAS added,
   but was taken out due to problems since changing the current
   directory makes it almost impossible to find the current
   .MZX file to read boards from.
 * Custom Critical Error Handler (no dos grey messages if the
   drive is invalid or something like that)
 * Password displayed as *'s when inputting, except on
   protection menu. (Do YOU think it should be *'s on
   protection menu? 'T'? CP?)
 * Enemys-hurt-enemys option added (GLOBAL info, SPEC. button)
 * "Show Robots" option added (Shift F2)
 * More help added
 * Fixed sensor bug (The player couldn't move onto it in most
   cases)
 * Fixed a bug where if you tried to Grab something via the
   Modify menu and the current thing was a scroll, sign, or
   robot that had no copy anywhere else on the current board,
   then the memory allocated to that object was not freed.
   (whew!)
 * A few more optimizations
 * Mouse disapears after a certain period of time of non-use
 * Boulders from the AVALANCHE potion, and explosions from the
   BLAST potion can't appear over an entrance anymore
 * Fixed some bugs in Text Export
 * Removed .BIN import- Waste of program space
 * Made ALL options (protection, ANSi import) available in
   unregistered- now registration is only for the games
 * Removed "suicide key" from game. Think about how it could
   screw up carefully planned cinemas, story sequences, etc.
 * Mouse support in character editor
 * Test function added
 * Speeded up saves and board switches
 * Slowed down all file access (okay, so it's not a feature,
   but it's more reliable, as is memory management as well)
 * Made save meter more accurate
 * BLOCK COMMANDS! (in editor)
 * ZZT board import (not perfectly accurate, but...)
 * Bug fixed where games with the title screen title at maximum
   length would mess up the file list box
 * MOD (SB & speaker) support! (& SAM)
 * Explosion-meets-player bug fixed
