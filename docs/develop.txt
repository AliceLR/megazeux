How to compile Mzx2.51s3.2
--------------------------

Get Turbo C++ version 3.0
Get Turbo Asm version 3.0 (hard to find, search for tasm3.zip)
Get the Bells, whistles and Sound boards library (easy to find)
Put " PATH = C:\TC\BIN ; %PATH% " in your autoexc.bat (change the directory to where you've put TC)
Open the TurboC ide
Open Megazeux.prj
Put the bwsb libs in C:\tc\lib
Put the bwsb headers in C:\tc\include
Put Turbo asm into C:\tc\bin
BUILD ALL the whole thing

All Objects are compiled so you COULD just LINK them if you loose mzx2.6 somehow...
