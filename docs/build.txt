MZX can currently be built on Windows (9x/2k/XP), Linux, MacOS X,
and PSP.

How to build MegaZeux 2.81d+:

First, you need the source for MZX, obviously, which can be found on
http://www.digitalmzx.net/ and http://sourceforge.net/projects/megazeux/

Next, you need the correct libraries installed, which are the
 following:

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/

libogg/libvorbis: http://xiph.org/downloads/

Now, you need to run the config script config.sh to begin the
installation process; this is only absolutely necessary on
non-Windows platforms, but is recommended universally. For Windows you
can run it in msys's rxvt shell. Run as following:

config.sh <platform> <prefix>

Where platform is win32, linux, macos, or psp and prefix is
typically /usr (supply the prefix where system directories lib,
include, bin, etc are located).

Now, you need GCC installed and GNU make to actually build. Currently,
GCC on Windows and Linux are supported. Type make and if you wish to
install to /${PREFIX}/bin follow it with make install. As of this
writing, the only compiler that has been tested on Windows is mingw.
I suggest anyone who's interested in building on Windows uses it:

http://www.mingw.org/


How to build for PSP:

To build for PSP you will want the PSP toolchain installed,
instructions on how to do so can be found at wiki.pspdev.org. For
Windows this should be installed under the Cygwin environment; an
alternative is DevkitPro which can be installed under mingw but this
is less supported and has only more recently matured and thus I haven't
been able to work with it yet.

For PSP builds you will need the PSP distribution of SDL and
libTremor instead of ogg/vorbis. Both can be found via SVN at

svn://svn.ps2dev.org

Once the proper libraries are installed run MZX's config script as
follows:

config.sh psp `psp-config --psp-prefix`

Then a simple make will generate a PSP 1.0 EBOOT.PBP file.
