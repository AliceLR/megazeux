BUILDING MEGAZEUX

MegaZeux can currently be built on Windows (9x/2k/XP), Linux, MacOS X,
GP2X and PSP.

For building on GP2X, see gp2x.txt.
For building on PSP, see psp.txt.

The following instructions are generic for all platforms.

DEPENDENCIES

MegaZeux depends on only three libraries with the most basic configuration.
These are the SDL, ogg and vorbis libraries.

SDL:			http://www.libsdl.org/
libogg/libvorbis:	http://xiph.org/downloads/

Installation of these libraries is not covered in this document, but on
many platforms there are pre-built binaries available. Under Linux, these
libraries will already be installed, but you may want to install the -dev
packages:

libogg-dev, libvorbis-dev, libsdl1.2-dev (Debian/Ubuntu)

CONFIGURING MEGAZEUX

All platforms must first invoke the config.sh script to configure the
build system. Type "./config.sh" inside a POSIX sh compatible shell
environment (on Windows, install MSYS/MINGW) to get more usage info.

Installing mikmod or libpng allows more features to be enabled, but
these libraries are optional and can be switched off from config.sh.

A normal compile line for Windows might be:

./config.sh --platform win32 --disable-libpng

BUILDING MEGAZEUX

Now, you need GNU GCC and GNU make to actually build. Type make and
if you wish to install to ${PREFIX}/bin follow it with make install.

The install target is only supported on Linux. package.sh can be
used to build ZIPs containing binary builds of MegaZeux, and is the
preferred means of distribution.
