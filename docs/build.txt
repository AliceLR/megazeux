MZX can currently be built on Windows (9x/2k/XP), Linux, and MacOS X.

How to build MegaZeux 2.80+:

First, you need the source for MZX, obviously, which can be found on
http://www.digitalmzx.net/ and http://www.zeuxworld.com/
(as of this writing. It should show up on megazeux.sourceforge.net
eventually)

Next, you need the correct libraries installed, which are the
 following:

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/

libmodplug: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/modplug-xmms/

gdm2s3m: http://mzx.bitpack.net/gdm2s3m-1.5-lite.tar.bz2
(should also show up on other sites soon)

NOTE: As of this writing, libmodplug (version 0.7) has a bug that
doesn't allow it to correctly load 2-channel FT2 saved mods. There
is a patch included to rectify this; you should patch libmodplug
before building if you have this version.

Now, you need to run the config script config.sh to begin the
installation process; this is only absolutely necessary on
non-Windows platforms, but is recommended universally. For Windows you
can run it in msys's rxvt shell. Run as following:

config.sh <platform> <prefix>

Where platform is win32, linux, or macos and prefix is typically /usr
(supply the prefix where system directories lib, include, bin, etc
are located).

Now, you need GCC installed and GNU make to actually build. Currently,
GCC on Windows and Linux are supported. Type make and if you wish to
install to /${PREFIX}/bin follow it with make install. As of this
writing, the only compiler that has been tested on Windows is mingw.
I suggest anyone who's interested in building on Windows uses it:
