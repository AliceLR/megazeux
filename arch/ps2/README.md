# Building MegaZeux for PS2

NOTE: Only tested on Linux.

## Preparation

You need to build or install the [ps2dev](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev) toolchain.

The toolchain comes with all MegaZeux dependencies pre-installed.

## Configuration

See CONFIG.PS2 for an optimal `config.sh' configure line. You need
to ensure PS2DEV is defined and valid.
