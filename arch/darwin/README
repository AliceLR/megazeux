BUILDING MEGAZEUX ON OS X

If you are building on the Darwin 9 platform (OS 10.4 or higher) you can build
MegaZeux without using Xcode by following the instructions in this file. The
resulting package will be a universal binary containing ppc and i686 code.

PREREQUISITES

You must have installed the SDL, libpng, Ogg, Vorbis frameworks somewhere on
your system. You do NOT have to install them to System or Library, if you
don't want. In this case, simply adjust the --prefix given to config.sh to
point to a local directory.

CONFIGURATION

The only tested config.sh line used to build for OS X is:

./config.sh --platform darwin --prefix $HOME/workspace/Frameworks \
            --disable-utils --disable-x11

(X11 support is disabled because it is incompatible with the Framework SDL
 package. If this bug is corrected, it can be re-enabled.)

BUILDING (i686)

You need Xcode's development tools package to have been installed. This does
NOT mean you need all of the Xcode IDE, but you do need the DMG file it is
installed from. This is normally included on your OS X install DVD #1. It is
enough to install the UNIX tools.

make ARCH=i686 all clean

Will build the i686 binary, and put it in the root as "mzxsvn.i686". It will
also clean the source tree, which is VERY IMPORTANT.

BUILDING (ppc)

This step is optional, but if you want to support G4 Macs running 10.4, you
need to do this.

make ARCH=ppc all clean

Will build the ppc binary, and put it in the root as "mzxsvn.ppc". It will
also clean the source tree, which is VERY IMPORTANT.

BUILDING AMD64/PPC64

The instructions above can also be repeated with ARCH=amd64 and ARCH=ppc64 for
64bit binaries (this may improve performance, but it is not necessary).

PACKAGING (+ UNIVERSAL BINARIES)

Simply run:

./package.sh -b darwin

This will output two files to the "dist" directory at the top level. One of
these is an installable universal Disk iMaGe, the other is a source package.
