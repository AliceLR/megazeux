BUILDING MEGAZEUX FOR PSP

As of 2.81d, MegaZeux can be built for PSP. The only supported toolchain for
this is pspdev.

devkitPSP, a build of pspdev previously distributed by devkitPro, is no longer
supported by devkitPro.

PREPARING TO BUILD

Before starting, the $PSPDEV variable needs to be defined correctly and the
path to the PSP toolchain needs to be added to $PATH variable. Both of these
steps are required for the following instructions to work. Example (add this
to your .profile or .bashrc file):

export PSPDEV=/opt/pspdev # Note: This var is equivalent to $DEVKITPSP.
export PATH=$PSPDEV/bin:$PATH

BUILDING DEPENDENCIES

Install the following library collection:

git clone https://github.com/pspdev/psplibraries.git
cd psplibraries
./libraries.sh

You might need to run the script twice, as it doesn't exactly do installation ordering correctly.

BUILDING MEGAZEUX FROM SOURCES

Extract the latest version of MegaZeux, or obtain it from Git.

cd megazeux
arch/psp/CONFIG.PSP
make package

This will create an EBOOT.PBP.

PACKAGING THE BUILD

make archive

To construct a bootable zip archive.
