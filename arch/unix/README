MEGAZEUX ON UNIX / UNIX CLONES

MegaZeux has been tested as compiling on the following UNIX / UNIX clones:

 - Linux (most architectures tested on hardware or QEMU via Alpine and Debian)
 - BSD (NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD are tested)
 - Haiku (R1 Beta 5 x86-64 most recently tested; x86 needs the newer compiler)
 - Solaris (OpenSolaris 2008.3 is tested)

Some of these platforms may have additional dependencies or installation
instructions, which will be added to this document over time.
