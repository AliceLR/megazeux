MEGAZEUX ON UNIX / UNIX CLONES

MegaZeux has been tested as compiling on the following UNIX / UNIX clones:

 - Linux (x86 / AMD64 / PPC / PPC64 are tested)
 - BSD (FreeBSD and OpenBSD are tested)
 - Solaris (OpenSolaris 2008.3 is tested)
 - HaikuOS (based on BeOS 5)

Some of these platforms may have additional dependencies or installation
instructions, which will be added to this document over time.
