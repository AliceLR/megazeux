PREPARATION

You need to install the latest versions of the following
libraries/tools:

  - libctru (https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib)
  - citro3d (https://github.com/fincs/citro3d)
  - picasso (https://github.com/fincs/picasso)
  - bannertool (https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool)
  - makerom (https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR)

You also need to install zlib, libpng and libtremor.
For this, you can use either:

  - devkitPro's portlibs (https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds_portlibs)
  - asie's portlibs (https://github.com/asiekierka/3ds_portlibs)

CONFIGURING

See CONFIG.3DS for an optimal `config.sh' configure line. You need
to ensure DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM are both defined and valid.

BUILDING

For the moment, you need to build with:

make package

This will emit "mzxrun.3dsx" and "mzxrun.cia" files.

PACKAGING THE BUILD

You can then use the usual "make archive" to build a
build/dist/3ds/mzxgit-3ds.zip file for distribution.
