PREPARATION

You need to install the following versions of the following libraries/tools:

  - Emscripten SDK (latest-upstream; https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
      - instead of "emsdk install/activate latest", please use "latest-upstream".
  - node.js (tested on v12.7.0, a variety of versions should work)

CONFIGURING

"./config.sh --platform emscripten --enable-release" is optimal for a web build as of writing.

BUILDING

For the moment, you need to build with:

make build

This will emit the necesary suite in build/emscripten/.

PACKAGING THE BUILD

You can then use the usual "make archive" to build a
build/dist/3ds/mzxgit-3ds.zip file for distribution.

TROUBLESHOOTING

If "assets.zip" is missing from build/emscripten, that is because the current Makefile is a bit wonky.
Please re-build with "make -B build".

If "unreachable" errors start appearing at random moments in the web browser's console, please try disabling the
"ASYNCIFY_WHITELIST" argument. That may fix it, in which case the whitelist must be updated.
