PREPARATION

You need to build or install the devkitARM toolchain.

CONFIGURING

See CONFIG.NDS for an optimal `config.sh' configure line. You need
to ensure DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM are both defined and valid.

BUILDING

For the moment, you need to build with:

make package

This will emit a "mzxrun.nds" which you should know how to launch.

PACKAGING THE BUILD

You can then use the usual "make archive" to build a
suitable .ZIP file for distribution.
