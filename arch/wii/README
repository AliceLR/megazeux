BUILDING MEGAZEUX FOR WII

As of 2.82b, MegaZeux can be built for the Wii. You will need the devkitPPC
toolchain, and libogc. You will also need the following in this directory:

  - libfat
  - libogg (audio only)
  - libvorbis (audio only)

Make sure DEVKITPRO and DEVKITPPC are both defined and valid, and use a
config.sh configure line such as:

./config.sh --platform wii --prefix $DEVKITPPC --disable-libpng \
            --disable-utils --enable-release --enable-meter

Then build with the command:

make package

This will create a "boot.dol" file which you should know how to launch.

PACKAGING

Use "make archive" to build a build/dist/wii/mzxgit-wii.zip file for
distribution.
