	<short_description>A simple game creation system (GCS)</short_description>
	<long_description>MegaZeux is a Game Creation System (GCS), inspired by
	Epic MegaGames' ZZT, first released by Gregory Janson in 1994. It was
	recently ported from 16bit MSDOS C/ASM to portable C/C++, improving its
	platform support and hardware compatibility.
	Many features have been added since the original DOS version, and with
	the help of an intuitive editor and a simple but powerful
	object-oriented programming language, MegaZeux allows you to create your
	own ANSI-esque games regardless of genre. It is actively maintained by a
	thriving community.
