MEGAZEUX ON GP2X

As of MegaZeux 2.81g, Simon Parzer donated a port of MegaZeux to the GP2X. It
has a few limitations, namely video (which has to be scaled down to 320x240),
some minor performance issues and missing keyboard controls.

It does however support playing MegaZeux games with support for sound effects
and music. Several popular titles have been tested.

CONFIGURATION

The GP2X port will override the default audio_buffer to 128 samples; there is
no need to set it explicitly in the config.txt. Also, the gp2x renderer will
be automatically selected; there is no need to set it explicitly in the
config.txt.

The file pad.config must be included in the distribution and copied from
arch/gp2x. This file contains necessary pad mappings for the GP2X controls.

COMPILATION

The only support toolchain for GP2X is the Open2X toolchain. It must be
installed andadded to your environment's PATH variable. For example, if
you have `arm-open2x-linux-gcc' in /usr/arm-linux/bin, you should do
the following:

  export PATH=/usr/arm-linux/bin:$PATH

It is now necessary to compile `SDL', `libmikmod' and `tremor'. Compilation 
of these libraries is not covered in this document. It may also be possible
to use the pre-compiled libraries come with your toolchain.

  http://libsdl.org/ (1.2.10 or later)
  http://mikmod.raphnet.net/ (3.1.11 or later)
  http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor/

Now you must run `config.sh'. The configuration script (config.sh) for the GP2X
platform assumes that --prefix will specify the path to the GP2X SDK. For
example, if you have the SDK installed to $TOOLCHAIN, you should specify:

  ./config.sh --platform gp2x --prefix $TOOLCHAIN --optimize-size \
              --disable-editor --disable-helpsys --disable-utils \
              --enable-mikmod --enable-release --enable-meter

The configuration script will automatically enable/disable other flags on this
platform; do not vary the command above, other than to change the prefix. The
flag `--enable-mikmod' may be replaced with `--disable-audio' if you wish to
disable audio support.

You may now type `make' as normal to contruct a suitable binary for the GP2X.

PACKAGING THE BUILD

You can then use "make archive" to build a build/dist/gp2x/mzxgit-gp2x.zip
file for distribution.
