MEGAZEUX ON GP2X

As of MegaZeux 2.81g, Simon Parzer donated a port of MegaZeux to the GP2X. It
has a few limitations, namely video (which is awkwardly scaled to a lower
resolution using hardware nearest-neighbour) and some minor performance issues.

It does however support playing MegaZeux games with support for sound effects
and music. Several popular titles have been tested.

CONFIGURATION

The configuration (config.txt) must be modified in the following ways:

  - "video_output = software"   Other renderers will fail
 OR "video_output = gp2x"       (Only on MZX versions >2.81)
  - "audio_buffer = 128"        Improves performance
  - "force_bpp = 8"             Improves performance

The file pad.config must be included in the distribution and copied from
arch/gp2x. This file contains necessary pad mappings for the GP2X controls
(the original is for the PSP platform).

COMPILATION

A suitable cross-compiler for ARM (which may be `devkitPro' for GP2X) must be
installed and added to your environment's PATH variable. For example, if you
have `arm-linux-gcc' in /usr/arm-linux/bin, you should do the following:

  export PATH=/usr/arm-linux/bin:$PATH

It is now necessary to compile `SDL', `libmikmod', `tremor' and `glibc'.
Compilation of these libraries is not covered in this document.

  http://libsdl.org/ (1.2.10 or later)
  http://mikmod.raphnet.net/ (3.1.11 or later)
  http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor/
  http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/

Now you must run `config.sh'. The configuration script (config.sh) for the GP2X
platform assumes that --prefix will specify the path to the GP2X SDK. For
example, if you have the SDK installed to /home/alistair/bin/gp2x-sdk, you
should specify:

  ./config.sh --platform gp2x --prefix /home/alistair/bin/gp2x \
              --optimize-size --disable-editor --disable-helpsys \
              --disable-utils --disable-modplug --enable-mikmod

The configuration script will automatically enable/disable other flags on this
platform; do not vary the command above, other than to change the prefix. The
flags `--disable-modplug --enable-mikmod' may be replaced with
`--disable-audio' if you wish to disable audio support.

You may now type `make' as normal to contruct a suitable binary for the GP2X.
It can be copied, together with the other resources (and config.txt, and
pad.config) to an MMC card for use on the GP2X.
