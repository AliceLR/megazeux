MEGAZEUX ON AMIGA OS 4

Since 2.82b, MegaZeux supports cross compilation to Amiga OS 4. You will
require a valid copy of the operating system software in order to run the
final result; this is not a bare-metal Amiga binary.

The only supported toolchain is for OS 4 and PPC Amigas.
m68k Amigas are not supported.

PREPARATION

The port requires that the Amiga OS 4 SDK and toolchain is installed. There
are several pre-built toolchains available from:

There is an excellent guide for linking your toolchain and the platform SDK
together here:

The SDL library for AmigaOS 4 (clib2) must be installed. I got my copy from:

BUILDING MEGAZEUX

First, configure MZX. A suitable config.sh command line is provided in
CONFIG.AMIGA present in this subdirectory. Please note that --prefix MUST
correctly point to the AmigaOS 4 SDK (otherwise it tries to use /usr's
stub headers and fails).

(The provided config omits PNG support; this is simply untested and can
 probably be easily re-enabled. I'm not sure about icon support on this
 platform, actually.)

Then start the build with "make".
