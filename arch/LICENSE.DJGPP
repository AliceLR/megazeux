Licenses for DJGPP, including most licenses in the relevant source code.
This *should* be all of them aside from slightly different copyright
dates, but there are quite a few and some have very minor differences.

Note "COPYING" is available as "LICENSE" and "COPYING.LIB" is available
as "LICENSE.LGPL2" as-distributed by MegaZeux.
