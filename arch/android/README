MEGAZEUX ON ANDROID

Android uses the Linux kernel and the build is similar to the UNIX one.

MegaZeux requires a new arch/ as the Android cross-compiler is weird and
uses hand-rolled linker flags to generate programs. This may go away over
time.

At the moment this Android port does nothing. It needs the following work:

  - Possibly fix up software renderer to use Skia (needed for old phones)
  - Implement audio support (audioflinger)

Most of the config.sh options work as-is, see docs/platform-matrix.html for
detailed information.

CHANGES TO ANDROID SOURCE TREE

At the moment the only change required to the source tree is to add a symlink
to work around a case issue when building on Linux:

cd $ANDROID_ROOT/external/tremor
ln -s Tremor tremor

You don't have to do this if you disable audio support (which makes a lot of
sense right now, actually).

BUILD DEPENDENCIES

Android makes this easy, because they bootstrap everything themselves. They
even provide the cross compiler. All you need to do is specify your android
build tree with "--prefix" and the build system does the rest.

CONFIGURATION

The config.sh line I've been using is:

./config.sh --platform android --prefix $HOME/android --disable-utils

However, I've made sure the utils build too, so the --disable-utils is
optional.

INSTALLATION

Fixme, right?
