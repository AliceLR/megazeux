BUILDING MEGAZEUX ON ANDROID

NOTE: Only tested on Linux.
NOTE: Requires a few gigabytes of hard drive space and some patience.

1. Install the latest version of both the Android SDK and NDK.
2. export NDK_PATH=[the NDK path]. As a hint, the directory should contain "ndk-build", among others.
    * For Android Studio users, this will be /home/.../Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/
   Create the file arch/android/project/local.properties with the following lines:
      ndk.dir=[NDK path here]
      sdk.dir=[SDK path here]
3. scripts/android/create-toolchains.sh
4. scripts/android/build-deps.sh
5. "scripts/android/build-mzx.sh megazeux" (pass mzxrun instead to build with mzxrun)
6. cd android
7. ./gradlew build

To change configuration options for the build, make a copy of build-mzx.sh and work from there.
