2.51s2final release:

+ Deleted cpu checking code, was unnecesary and caused errors.
+ Fixed bug involving mod * settings being lost when loading
+ Should have fixed ems problems some were reporting, if not, just
  try to get more conventional memory.

2.5.1s2beta release:

+ added MOD "*", which allows a board to use whatever module the previous
  board was using; this necessitated a change in the .SAV file format
  (still need changes in the editor UI to access this feature outside of
   Robotic)
+ inmate's semantics for MOD "SOMETHIN.MOD*" aren't immediately possible,
  although a rough hack is in already
+ char edits are now not displayed until the beginning of the next cycle;
  the deferred display should eliminate a lot of flickering
+ an (at least partial) fix for the infamous UNDER bug (thanks JZig!)
+ MOUSEX, MOUSEY and BUTTONS are now buffered.
+ more sane magic handling
+ can load MZX 2.51 and 2.51S1 worlds, but will only save 2.5.1spider2 format


2.51S1 release:
 

+ Increased counters to 1000.
+ Added following counters: (ro) is read only, (r&w) is read + write
(r&w) MOUSEX, MOUSEY - Location of mouse cursor over the screen.
(ro)  BUTTONS - Status of the buttons (none=0,left=1,right=2,both=3)
(ro)  MBOARDX, MBOARDy - Location of mouse cursor over the board.
(ro)  SCROLLEDX, SCROLLEDY - Length the screen has been scrolled in each direction.
(ro)  PLAYERX, PLAYERY - Location of the player
(r&w) CURSORSTATE - Turns on & off the hardware cursor (0= off, 1= on, 0 default)

+ Added new independant counter like LOOPCOUNT, named LOCAL, it's now possible
  for a robot to search the screen or something without wasting a counter.
* New .MZX and .SAV formats for MZX2.51S1.
* .SAV files from 2.51S1 are incompatible with 2.51, and vice-versa
* 2.51S1 is capable of loading 2.51 .MZX world files.
* 2.51 is not capable of loading .MZX files created or opened & saved in 2.51S1




2.51 release: (quick bug-fix release while working on 3.00)

 * NOTE: I HAVE decided to release a 3.00 version of MegaZeux using
	PROTECTED MODE and a large number of enhancements. Visit the Software
	Visions web site for details. Betas will be PUBLIC.

 * Bug where moving north or west towards a board that is larger than 100
	tiles in a dimension may not work properly fixed.
 * Bugs in 2GDM.EXE preventing proper conversion of some S3Ms fixed.
 * A rare bug preventing internal MOD conversion fixed.
 * "Error opening MOD" will no longer appear during normal gameplay.
 * Exporting ANSis now adds a color to the end returning text to normal
	grey. (so TYPEing them in DOS no longer screws up the DOS colors)

2.50 release:

 * FOR ALL YOU 2.07 USERS- THE MAJOR UPGRADE is the new sound code! Support
	for stereo, 16-bit, more cards, 4 sound effects channels, 32 music
	channels, higher quality, and faster sound code! Less bugs! More formats
	supported! All non-MOD files MUST be converted to GDM using the included
	2GDM.EXE program. Formats supported- MOD (up to 32 channels), WOW/OCT/NST,
	S3M, 669, and MTM.

 * Volume controls (overall and SAM) added to F2-Settings (saved in .CFG file)
 * SAMs play at 2x volume.
 * MTM support added to 2GDM.EXE. Other formats aren't added because they
	aren't needed (not used often enough) or in the case of XM, because they
	support too many advanced features that MZX does not support. Partial
	XM support MAY be added later.
 * Many minor bug fixes in 2GDM.EXE's conversion routines.
 * Internal MOD conversion (in MegaZeux) sped up considerably.
 * For all those that upgraded from 2.07, see 2.49g and 2.48b WHATS-NEW
	for more stuff, including a couple interesting new Robotic features

 * This is the LAST planned release of MegaZeux. I may release bug-fix
	upgrades but that is it. I am moving on to new projects. (I will still
	support MegaZeux, of course.)

2.49g release:

 * New Import function added- You can import an ANSi to any position on the
	board.
 * Full SAM sound effect support as in the original 2.07 version (but using
	the new MOD code for up to 4 simultaneous channels)
 * The OPEN Robotic command will now push the Robot out of the way if the
	door would be blocked by the robot.
 * REL PLAYER and REL COUNTERS now affects the THISX/THISY counters
	(giving the distance FROM the player/counters TO the Robot) and the
	prefixes also affect the IF [dir] BLOCKED command, allowing you to
	check for blocked status next to the player or an arbitrary position.
 * [ box message statements now clip their message to 64 characters (the
	maximum) on display. Note that all other box-message statements are
	NOT clipped!
 * Color codes are allowed in ? and & box message statements
 * Invalid sound card settings no longer cause a lock-up
 * You can hold down the mouse button to cycle through RGB values in the
	palette editor
 * Changing something to an explosion no longer can cause weird colors
 * Whats New section of help sorted by version
 * Placing a robot over the player is prevented with a warning
 * The "Alt+N- Music" lights up properly in the editor now
 * When chaning from a larger board to a smaller board, you can no longer
	accidentally have the cursor outside of the board size
 * GUS owners don't need to enter # of SFX channels, since MegaZeux
	cannot support GUS sound effects anyways.
 * Fileboxes (loading MODs, worlds, etc.) can now hold as many filenames
	as memory allows.
 * GUS setup shown properly on configuration screen
 * 2GDM.EXE rewritten- In THIS release, it can only convert MOD, NST, WOW,
	OCT, 669, and S3M files! The final (2.50) release will have support for
	the remaining file formats. It is being rewritten to fix many small bugs
	and make it smaller and faster, as well as possibly add more file
	formats.
 * 2GDM.EXE- F00 effect in MODs deleted during conversion
 * 2GDM.EXE- Bad effects S8x, S0x, and Xxx deleted during S3M conversion
 * 2GDM.EXE now works properly from other directories
 * INTERNAL MOD loading support. You can now load MODs, NSTs, WOWs, and OCTs
	from within the game without having to convert them to GDM first. The
	only exception is 15-instrument MODs- they must first be converted. Note
	that all other formats, such as S3M, 669, etc. must still be converted.
	NST/WOW/OCT support was only added because they are extremely similar to
	MODs, and MODs were required for backward compatibility.
 * Insert doesn't display those "Lo bomb selected" messages, etc. if the
	player is Attack Locked or settings say he cannot bomb.
 * Minor bugs in ANSi import corrected. (problem fixed- caused errors
	on import of ANSis with more or the same number of lines as the
	current board size maximum)
 * "Ammo <10" and "Ammo >9" entries in Global Chars changed to "Small
	Ammo" and "Large Ammo" to prevent confusion.

2.48b release:

 * ALL NEW music code! Features include faster, NO BUGs, 32 channels,
	more formats supported (sorry, no MID or XM) etc. See the section
	entitiled 'MegaZeux's Sound System' for details. (in Help)
 * Bug where selecting "(no board)" to add a board caused an error if
	that wasn't the first "(no board)" on the list.
 * Bug where if a robot line entered consisted of only semicolons, spaces,
	and commas, it would screw up that robot's program, fixed.
 * Command line options (-port,-dma,-irq) added for setting sound card
	parameters. Only needed if auto-detection fails.
 * Minor help corrections.

	was "megahertz".)
 * Minor bugs in passage search algorithms corrected.
 * Obscure bug involving REL prefixes if used in "infinite-loop" type
	constructs (fixed)

 * Bug where passages on screens wider than 256 spaces didn't work
	properly. (fixed)
 * Bug where fire-to-player's-right would lock up and kill him FIXED.
 * Counters can be used in ALL strings in &COUNTER& notation. For example,
	SEND "ROBOT" "LABEL&COUNTER&" will replace &COUNTER& with a number.
	This works for ALL strings- counternames, labels, robots, etc. See
	Robotic help for details.

2.07 release:

	on. (only if it was in a string of things to push)

	things over a fake or floor erased the fake/floor. (etc)

	between like objects (IE text to text) Also made more robust against
	attempts to change things to robots/scrolls/signs/sensors/players.
 * Put commands- Made more robust against attempts to put robots/scrolls/
	signs/sensors/players.

 !ADDED 14 COMMANDS (all commands finished)
 !ADDED  2 DIRECTIONS (randp, randnot)
 * Help brings up Robot Table of Contents within robot editor

 * Bug fixed in editor- Now colors like c7? (with ? at end) work right.
 * Calibrate Joystick button added to Game options (F2) Tony- See if this
	helps.

	really slow file access.

 * Video mode returns to default VGA mode (text 16x9) on exit

	invalid or something like that)

	else on the current board, then the memory allocated to that object was
	not freed. (whew!)

 * Boulders from the AVALANCHE potion, and explosions from the BLAST potion
	can't appear over an entrance anymore
 * Fixed some bugs in Text Export
 * Removed .BIN import- Waste of program space
 * Made ALL options (protection, ANSi import) available in unregistered-
