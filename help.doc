:071:Overview of MegaZeux

$~EWelcome to MegaZeux! Use the arrow keys to Scroll
$~Ethis text, and ESC when you are done reading.

$~BPress END to learn about the NEW FEATURES in
$~BMegaZeux 2.80!

As you may already know, MegaZeux is a game system which
allows you to play almost limitless worlds in dated yet
charming graphics and with excellent digitized music and sound.
Not only are there several MZX worlds out there already, but
new worlds are being uploaded to large websites like
DigitalMZX. However, the most fabulous feature of MegaZeux is
the World Editor.

Using the World Editor, ANYONE can create the world of their
dreams. Make it as simple or complex (well, almost), as easy
or difficult, as long or short as you please. We aren't just
talking about worlds made up of petty, pre-programmed enemies
and objects; MegaZeux has its own, easy-to-use PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE called Robotic that allows you to create objects,
engines and worlds that do almost anything you desire.

For the new user, it's recommended that you play Caverns, the
first ever MegaZeux game, to get the feel of more simple yet
well-designed games in MegaZeux. You may wish to read the help
section entitled "Controls" to learn how to play MegaZeux.

If you're more adventurous, start with a more complex game like
Demon Earth or a prettier game like Kaboink! to see what kind
of advanced functions, bells and whistles MZX can offer.

Once you have the feel for the game, feel free to dive into the
World Editor and get messy! You should probably read the help
section entitled "The World Editor" first.

To go to one of these sections now, hit Enter after aligning
the arrows with one of these choices. Press ESC now to exit to
the game.

#CONTROLS.HLP
:091:Controls

MegaZeux is very easy to play once you understand the simple
control system. After that, experimentation will prove to be
the best teacher, although you can discover the basics within
Help as well.

To start a game, press 'P' during the title screen. To
select another world, press 'L' during the title screen. Use
ESC during the title screen to exit to your OS, or during the
game to return to the title screen. You know it is the title
screen if a message on the bottom says "Press F1 for help,
Enter for menu". This will appear unless the game file tells
MZX to overwrite this message (which does happen a fair
amount). Enter will bring up a menu of options on the title
screen as well.

Your character is represented by a little smiley face in the
Zeux games. @1~B@8~F In other games, he may be a stick person,
animal, spaceship, or other entity. Usually it is obvious
where you are, since you are usually colored to stand out.

To move your character, press one of the arrow keys on
the keyboard or numeric keypad unless told otherwise. If you
hold it down, you will continue to move in that direction.

To interact with objects and other characters, you usually must
stand next to them and touch them. This basically means you 
must push against them using the arrow keys. Watch out for
enemies and evil creatures, who can hurt you when you touch
them.

To stop enemies, you will often have some type of weapon, often
with limited ammunition. The actual weapon depends upon the
game, and its presence may even differ from game to game, but
by default you have a small pistol. To fire the default weapon,
hold Space and press an arrow key. You can also hold the arrow
key and press Space. You must press both keys TOGETHER.

To see your current status, such as Health points, Coins,
Gems, Ammunition, and Keys, press Enter. This will bring up
a box containing all your stats, as well as a menu detailing
other options you have available. Some newer games will
disable this menu or change its action entirely.

In some games, you may encounter bombs. (As usual, push
against them to pick them up.) To use a bomb, press the Del 
key... then run! The bomb will not actually burn its fuse
until you step away from it. There are two styles of bomb -
Low strength and High strength. You can tell which kind you
pick up by the pitch of the sound it makes. To change which
TYPE of bomb you are using, press Ins or F5. A message at the
bottom of the screen will inform you of your new selection.

Other games may have other controls, such as 'S' to cast a
spell or 'J' to jump, but they should be detailed within the
game. Some basic play tips:

~A*~F RTFM (Read the Flipping Manual). Whatever information
. the game has to give is probably important. Some authors
. include info files in their distributions; make sure these
. are read.

~A*~F Make sure you visit every screen. To get to other screens,
. enter passageways, stairs, caves, or doors (by pushing
. against them). You can also often reach another screen
. by pushing against the edge of the screen, leading to an
. adjacent screen.

~A*~F Touch everything! Even things of seemingly little value
. may prove worthy of your attention. If it kills you, then...
. well... hope you saved.

~A*~F Save your game! It is rather simple- Press F3 to save your
. game to disk at the EXACT point you are at, if allowed. 
. Press F4 to reload a game off of disk. You can use F9 and
. F10 to quick-save and quick-load, which work on the last game
. you saved. Remember to save often- If something kills you,
. you'll want a game to go back to.

~A*~F Collect supplies! Make sure you grab every coin, gem,
. ammo dump, bomb, chest, pouch, and foobar you see! You will
. often be in want of supplies, so don't push things.

~A*~F Remember how things work. Most things in MegaZeux have
. patterns, and the same object will usually do the same
. thing all the time. (However, two objects may look alike
. and not really be the same thing.)

~A*~F If all else fails, look in the game via the editor. 
. This depends on the clarity of the code of the author(s), but
. looking in the Editor can help if all other solutions have
. been exhausted.

#ADVANCED.HLP
:1st:Advanced Play Info, Tips

You've tried some MegaZeux worlds, and they are fun, but you
have the feeling you are missing something. This is it- the
remaining knowledge you might need to survive in a given world.

First, let me warn you that many worlds you get from archives
or (especially) from personal webpages may not be of a very
good quality. They may be unfair, boring, have bugs, and/or
not give proper instructions. My advice is to email the author
and tell him what you think of poor quality MegaZeux games.
There is no problem in MAKING them, but PLEASE don't upload
them, even in these days where games are fewer and farther
between. Don't let a few dull games ruin the fun.

Now to cover the game keys in detail-

F1- Help
Use this at any time to bring up help relating to the current
situation. Within the game, you will go to the Controls
section.

Enter- Menu/Status
Use this to bring up a menu of options and a list of your
current stats, such as Score, Gems, etc. Some games may have
this key do nothing, or even something different entirely.

ESC- Exit to Title
This will quit the current game and return to its title
screen.

:092:F2- Settings
This will bring up a dialog box where you can change the
current game settings, such as Game Speed, Music, and Sound.
To speed up the game, lower the speed and/or turn music off. A
speed of 1 will cause flicker in most machines, so it is not
recommended unless it is your only option. Please note that
some games may have the speed change by itself, and this speed
WILL carry over to other games.

:096:F3- Save Game
This will prompt you for a filename, then save the exact
state of your current game. Some games may not allow saving
on some or all of its screens, or will only allow saving in
certain spots. Saving lets you quit your game in the middle or
take precautions against unknown dangers.

F4- Restore Game
This will let you select a saved game from a list of filenames.
The game will then be reloaded from the same point you left
off.

F5 or Ins- Toggle Bomb Type
This will switch your current bomb type between High Strength
and Low Strength.

F6- Debug Mode
This will bring up a small box in the lower left corner of the
screen, detailing your position and the current memory
situation. It is generally only necessary when testing and
fixing your own games. Press F6 again to turn the box off. 
The debug menu, when active, will also increase the sensitivity
to module and SAM/WAV problems. Normally during the game, no
errors relating to modules and SAMs/WAVs will be shown. With
the debug menu on, errors loading modules and SAMs/WAVs as well
as out-of-memory conditions will be shown.

F9- Quicksave
This will save the game, like F3, but to the last filename you
used without prompting you for a filename. The old file will
be overwritten. If no game has been saved since MegaZeux was
started, the save will have the default filename listed in the
config.txt file.

F10- Quickload
This will reload the last game saved using F3 or F9. If no
game has been saved since MegaZeux was started, the default
save filename will be used.
>#CONFGINI.HLP:1st:The Config File

Arrows- Move
The arrow keys will move your character and allow him/her/it to
interact with most objects in most games.

Space- Shoot
By default, one uses this key in conjunction with an arrow
key to fire a weapon in the selected direction. Weapons and
spacebar uses vary from world to world.

Del- Bomb
By default, this will drop a bomb of the current type BENEATH
the player. Move out of the way to see it, then run before it
explodes! Uses of the del key vary from game to game.

The following keys are active at the title screen-

F1- Help (see above)

Enter- Menu
This is similar to default Enter within the game. However,
there is no status screen.

ESC- Exit to DOS
Pressing ESC will exit MegaZeux, returning to the native OS.

F2 or S- Settings (see above)

F3 or L- Load World
This will allow you to load up the title screen of any MegaZeux
world. A list of choices will be presented to you to select
from. After the world is loaded, you may watch the title
screen, then press 'P' to play.

F4 or R- Restore Game (see above)

F5 or P- Play Game
This will stop the title screen and actually begin game play.

F6- Debug Menu (see above)

F8 or E- World Editor
This will quit the gaming portion of MegaZeux and enter the
integrated World Editor. For detailed info on using the World
Editor, view the appropriate help sections.
>#THEWORLD.HLP:1st:The World Editor

F10- Quickload (see above)

We'll close this section with some more playing tips, and some
general hints.

* Don't take anything for granted. If it looks like a spike,
. it probably is. _probably_. Although it is rare that these
. types of puzzles must be solved to complete a game, there
. are often bonuses, hidden rooms, etc. behind illusions.

* Don't trust anyone. All characters in a game (including
. yourself) have the potential to lie, cheat, and backstab.

* Try things twice, even thrice. Sometimes objects respond
. differently at other times. If you get a new treasure, go
. talk to all the citizens- maybe one of them will say
. something new.  If some place seems inaccessible, come back
. later!

#DIALOGBO.HLP
:098:How to Use Dialog Boxes

A large portion of MegaZeux's interface is made up of dialog
boxes. They are rather simple and intuitive to use, but 
instructions for the uninformed are included in this section.

A dialog box is a form of inputting various information. An
example of a dialog box is the Save Game box, or the Settings
box. (both in the game) To use a box is simple- Use TAB and
SHIFT+TAB to highlight an element, and type or use the cursor
keys to change the value. Press ENTER on a button (Rectangle
with a label) to exit the dialog or produce an effect.

If you have a mouse, you can click on a dialog box element to
select it, or click on a selected element to change it. Click
on a selected button to activate it.

You can usually use Home to jump to the first section of the
dialog box, and End to jump to the OK or NEXT button.

The different dialog box elements and special related keys
are explained in detail for the remainder of this section.

INPUT- This is where you type in a series of characters,
usually letters and numbers. You can move the cursor around
within the line, type to insert characters, move to the start
with Home, and move to the end with End.

NUMBER- This is where you have a number and you change it
with the arrow keys or mouse clicks on buttons. Up and Down
will change it by 1, Alt+Up and Alt+Down will change it by
10, and PageUp and PageDown will change it by 100. You can
also hold the mouse button down on one of the arrows to
change the number.

NUMBER LINE- This is a line of numbers, with one highlighted.
Similar to the above, but in a limited range.

CHARACTER- This is where you can select a single character.
Press a character to use that character, or click on it or
press Enter to get a large menu of characters to select from.

COLOR- This is where you can select a single color. Press
Enter or click on it to get a large menu of colors to choose
from.

CHECK BOXES- These are On/Off switches. Use Up/Down to move
within the list of choices, and use Space, Enter, or mouse
clicks to toggle choices on and off. An [X] means the option
is currently on.

RADIO BUTTONS- These are similar to Check Boxes, but are
mutually exclusive. The mouse or arrow keys will select the
current and ONLY option that is on. The () shows the current
option.

BUTTON- These are rectangles with labels. When selected,
press Enter or click to activate. OK or Done will verify the
contents of the dialog box. Cancel will cancel any changes
you've made. (ESC will usually do this as well.) Next and
Previous move between multiple dialog boxes. Other buttons
do what their label signifies and are explained in the
appropriate help section.

LISTS- These show a selection from a list of choices. The
current selection is shown. Press Enter or click on it to
bring up a list of choices from which you can select a new
choice.

>#MOUSESUP.HLP:1st:Mouse Support in MegaZeux
>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#MOUSESUP.HLP
:1st:Mouse Support in MegaZeux

Its use is very simple. Move the mouse to move the mouse
cursor. Press the Left mouse button to select something,
activate something, etc. Certain games may make use of
the mouse.

#FRIENDSA.HLP
:1st:Friends and Foes- Objects You Will Encounter

The following help section contains a list of the different
objects, enemies, items, and terrains you will find within
the different MegaZeux worlds.

$@0~8± ~FTerrains~8 ±@8

~BSpace

This is the simplest terrain; it does absolutely nothing!

~BNormal     ~A@0²
~BSolid      ~EÛ
~BTree      ~A
~BLine     ~FÍÍÍÍÍ
~BCustom Block  ~7?

These are all basic walls; they just get in the way. Sometimes
trees can be burned down.

~BBreakaway    ~C@0±
~BCustom Break  ~7?

These block movement as well, but they can be destroyed with
most weapons (such as bullets or bombs). Certain other things
can destroy them as well.

~BFake      ~A²
~BCarpet     ~4@0±
~BFloor      ~9@0°
~BTiles      ~0@Fþ
~BCustom Floor  ~7?

These are all treated as flooring, or "background". Anything,
including yourself, can move onto and over these. They are
primarily for decoration.

~BWeb       ~7Å
~BThick Web    ~7Î

These are another type of flooring. However, webs are often
the home for spiders, so watch your step!

~BForest     ~2@0²

This terrain will block the path of almost anything. You,
however, can move through it with ease, clearing a pathway.
Enemies can move along a cleared path.

~BInvis. Wall

This LOOKS like just an empty space... until you bump into it.
Then it becomes a normal wall, blocking your path.

$@0~8± ~FItems~8 ±@8

~BGem       
~BMagic Gem    

Collecting gems is fun! Your total number of gems is shown on
the status screen, and each gem gives you one point. Many
older games also use them as a type of currency, where you can
trade gems for stuff like food, ammo, weapons, or hints. Magic
Gems also give you one health point apiece when taken.

~BHealth     ~C

This will improve your outlook dramatically- Your health is
increased by a certain amount. The amount varies for different
hearts.

~BRing      ~Eo
~BPotion     -

These mystical items will bestow a magical effect on you when
you wear or drink them. The effect, however, is unknown to
you until you try it... and some effects aren't so nice.
>#POTIONFX.HLP:1st:Potion and Ring Effects

~BEnergizer    ~1E

After grabbing an energizer, you will flash colors for a
limited time. During this period, you are invincible against
enemies, bullets, fire, and most other forms of pain. Be
careful not to get into a dangerous situation as your energy
runs out!

~BAmmo      ~3£ ¤

When you grab ammunition, it will add a certain amount of
ammo to your supplies. The amount may be different for
different piles. Some worlds or sections of worlds may have
weapons with infinite ammunition.

~BBomb      ~0


Each bomb you grab adds another to your supply. The sound made
when you grab the bomb will be high-pitched for a high strength
bomb and low-pitched for a low strength bomb.

~BKey       ~A


Collect keys to open locks, doors, and gates later on. The key
and the lock/etc. must match colors, and a key will only work
once. You can carry up to sixteen keys at once. The default
status screen, if on, will show your current supply of keys.

If you've played ZZT games, you'll be interested to know that
you can carry multiple keys of the same color.

~BLock      ~A

A lock will only open if you have a key of the same color to
unlock it. The key can only be used once and will disappear
along with the lock.

~BCoin      ~E
Collecting coins is a good idea- they not only increase your
score, but can usually be used to purchase valuable items or
services from vendors.

~BLife      ~Do

A life orb will give you yet another chance for survival in
MegaZeux.

~BPouch      ~7E

A pouch is usually filled with coins and gems. The amount
varies, but often you will find yourself pleasantly rich....

~BChest      ~6

A chest can contain numerous things. The contents will be one
of the following: Empty, a Key, Coins, Lives, Ammo, Health,
a Potion or Ring, Bombs, or Gems. Once you grab the contents,
the chest itself will remain, but be empty.

$@0~8± ~FCreatures~8 ±@8

~BSnake      ~2E

A snake moves in a straight line until it hits an obstruction,
then aims itself in another direction and continues. Hitting a
snake (like all enemies hereafter unless noted) will cause you
to lose 10 health, then kill the snake.

~BEye       ~FE

An eye chases you down like any ordinary enemy, but when it
catches you or dies, it explodes! The size of the explosion
varies with each eye.

~BThief      ~C

A thief chases you, but doesn't hurt you. Instead, it steals
your gems!

.        ~A*
~BSlime Blob   ~A*±*
.        ~A*

A slime blob usually doesn't hurt you (although you can often
still kill it by touching or shooting it) but it can quickly
become annoying because of its habit of dividing into more
slime blobs, then hardening into "solid slime", (breakables)
quickly filling rooms....

~BRunner     ~C

A runner does that- runs back and forth. Often they take more
than one hit to kill- up to four hits may be required. However,
they are rather dumb and often slow.

~BGhost      ~7E

A ghost is the simplest enemy, simply chasing you. While some
of them are invincible, most can be killed.

~BDragon     ~4 ~C ~E*~C

Some dragons move around slowly, but their main advantage is
their offense- they can shoot barrages of scorching flame. 
They also have a strong defense, taking up to 8 hits to kill. 
These powers make them one of the most formidable default
inhabitants of MegaZeux. Touching them will take 10 health,
but will NOT hurt the dragon.

~BFish      ~EE

Fish have to stay in the water and often won't hurt you. Some
take two hits to kill.

~BShark      ~7

Sharks swim in the lava, and attempt to chase you. They fire
projectiles at you from their relatively safe position. These
projectiles can be bullets, seekers, or fire.

.        ~0ÚÅ¿
~BSpider    ~0ÄÅ~7•~0ÅÄ
.        ~0ÀÅÙ

Spiders, although eager to catch you, are usually restricted to
movement on webs. Certain spiders, however, can actually stray
off the webs. Some spiders take 2 hits to kill.

~BGoblin     ~2

Goblins are curious little creatures. They rush at you, then
stop for a moment to consider the situation. This is usually a
very good time to kill them.

~BSpitting Tiger ~BE ~FE EE

Spitting tigers act very similar to sharks, except tigers move
on land and therefore are much more likely to reach you and rip
you limb from limb.

~BBear      ~6¬

Bears only move if you get too close, then they lumber over for
the attack. Many require 2 hits to kill.

~BBear Cub    ~6­

Bear cubs are very lively, rushing all over the place. Since
they move so fast in a seemingly random manner, they are often
hard to kill.

~BBullet Gun ~F" " 

Bullet guns fire in one direction only and are indestructible.
They usually fire bullets, but some may fire scorching flame.
Some guns aim better or fire more often than others.

~BSpinning Gun ~C~E* ~F

Spinning guns are similar to bullet guns except they are
constantly rotating, allowing firing from all four cardinal
directions.

~BLazer Gun    ~0Î~1E9E3EBEF‚‚‚‚~7E

Lazer guns fire off lazer walls at regular intervals, and
sustain these walls for a specific length of time. They are
very logical in their manner, and are also indestructible.

~BMissile Gun   ~0

Missile guns fire missiles in one direction. Some fire just
once while others can fire missiles indefinitely. The gun
itself is indestructible.

$@0~8± ~FPuzzle Pieces~8 ±@8

The following objects are often used in conjunction with each
other to create mind-twisting puzzles requiring you to push
objects all over the place to reach a goal. Be warned.

~BBoulder     ~7E
~BCrate      ~6þ
~BCustom Push   ~7?

Boulders and crates can be pushed in any direction, with any
number of pushable things in a row. They can be blown up.

~BBox       ~Fþ
~BCustom Box   ~7?

Boxes can also be pushed in any direction, but cannot be blown
up.

~BPusher     ~0 ~7þþþ

Pushers cannot hurt you, but they constantly move in one given
direction, pushing almost anything in their path- Boxes,
crates, and even you!

~BSlider NS    ~E
~BSlider EW    ~E

Sliders can be pushed also, but ONLY in the pointed direction,
Slider NS can only be pushed north/south, while slider EW can
only be pushed east/west.

$@0~8± ~FTransport~8 ±@8

~BStairs     ~F¢
~BCave (or door) ~0¡
~BWhirlpool    ~9@1@-

When you enter any one of these, you are transported to another
location within the current world. These are not always
two-way connections.

~BCW       ~A/
~BCCW       ~A\

These rotate in the given direction (ClockWise or
CounterClockWise) rotating everything around them at the same
time. Walls and other solid objects will not be affected.

.        ~Fv
~BTransport   ~F} {
.        ~F~~

A transporter is an interesting thing. Most of them face a
single direction. Entering these on the "open" side, or
pushing other things into them, will transport to another
location. Some transporters rotate 360 degrees and can be
entered from any side.

The destination of your transport is rather complex, but the
search pattern is as follows:

1. If the other side of the entered transport is empty, move
.  there. If there is something there that can be pushed out
.  of the way, move there and push it out of the way.
2. If the other side is blocked, continue in that direction
.  looking for the first non-blocked transporter facing the
.  OPPOSITE direction, or an "any-direction" transport.
3. If none can be found, no transport takes place.

~BStill Water   ~9@1°
~BN Water     ~9@1
~BS Water     ~9@1
~BE Water     ~9@1
~BW Water     ~9@1

Water is a type of floor that can be moved onto by you, some
enemies, and certain other objects. Often water has a current,
moving you constantly in a certain direction.

~BIce       @3\

Ice is another type of floor. However, you slip on it,
constantly moving out of control in the last direction you
moved.

~BLava     @4~C±²°±²

Lava is another floor. However, it is (almost always) very
deadly. Only a few things can survive over it.

~BFire     @0~C±°~E²±~C²

Fire is yet another type of floor. It often will spread across
the floor, enveloping trees and chests. It is rather painful
to stand near (or worse, on), but it does not mean
instantaneous death. Most fire will eventually burn out.

~BLit Bomb    ~0(c)

A lit bomb is an explosion on a fuse. You DON'T want to be
nearby when the fuse runs out....

.        ~F@E±
.        ~F@E±~C±~F±
~BExplosion   ~F@E±~C±@4±@E±~F±
.        ~F@E±~C±~F±
.        ~F@E±

An explosion is very cool. It starts at a certain point,
quickly spreading outward, wreaking havoc in its wake. Some
explosions are smaller than others. Explosions will also cause
explosives such as bombs to explode, leading to some very cool
chain reactions.

~BGoop      ~8@1°°°

Goop is pretty much untraversable terrain to anything, although
sharks may occasionally inhabit it. Bullets, lazers, and other
projectiles will traverse it freely. Goop may also be treated
as water or other terrains in certain worlds.

$@0~8± ~FMiscellaneous~8 ±@8

~BDoor     ~2±²Û~AÄ~2Û²±

A door is what you would expect- When you touch it, it will
open itself, closing after a brief pause. Certain doors are
locked and require you to use a key to open them. They then
remain unlocked.

~BGate     ~7±²ÛÛ²±

A gate also opens up when touched, but doesn't move anywhere.
An open gate simply looks like this: Ä and can be freely moved
across. Like doors, certain gates may be locked.

~BRicochet Panel ~0/

When a bullet hits a ricochet panel it is reflected to travel
in a new direction, depending upon the way the panel is facing.

~BRicochet    ~A*

When a bullet hits a ricochet, it is reflected back in the
original direction.

~BMine      ~4E

A mine will just sit there, blinking, until it is touched or
otherwise activated. Then it will be gone, prey to its own
destructive explosion. What a pity.

~BSpike      ~7
~BCustom Hurt   ~7?

Spikes and other painful devices will simply hurt you if you
touch them. Often used in conjunction with ice.

~BText      ~7?

Another type of wall. Gets in the way, but often provides
hints or other enlightening messages.

~BMoving Wall N  ~7?
~BMoving Wall S  ~7?
~BMoving Wall E  ~7?
~BMoving Wall W  ~7?

Moving walls are like Runners- They just sit there and move back
and forth, to and fro... they can't hurt you by touch, but can
get in the way very easily.

$@0~8± ~FObjects~8 ±@8

~BPlayer     @1~B

This is you. Really. Different worlds might have different
representations for the player, however.

~BScroll     ~FE

Touch this to read a message. A Scroll will disappear after
you finish reading it.

Unlike in ZZT, scrolls are text-only: they cannot execute any
commands.

~BSign      ~6E

Touch this to read a message. The sign will remain afterwards.

~BMissile     ~0

Missiles fly around the room, turning at obstructions. They
will explode if they hit you or a dead end.

~BBullet     ~F"

Bullets (or other projectile weapons such as arrows) will fly
in a straight line until they hit something (and disappear) or
do damage to someone or something. Ricochets can change the
direction a bullet is traveling in. There are three types of
bullets: Player (the player shoots these by default), Neutral
(Robots shoot these in a default shoot command), and Enemy 
(built-in enemies shoot these by default).

~BSeeker     ~A|

A seeker, thrown by a Tiger, Shark, or other enemy, will chase
you all over the screen until they collide and do 10 damage.
They have a limited life, however, and will expire after
a certain amount of time. They are still, however, one of the
deadliest weapons you will face.

~BShooting Fire ~C ~E*~C

Shooting fire will continue in a straight line until it hits
you, resulting in pain, or a wall, resulting in a small fire.
The fire may quickly spread out of control in some areas, or
just burn out in others.

~BSensor     ~7?

Sensors are a form of floor that only you can move onto. They
will usually then produce some form of effect, by interacting
with a Robot.

~BRobot      ~7?
~BPushable Robot ~7?

Robots are the workhorses, the artisans, the...nearly
everythings of MegaZeux. They are highly flexible objects
which can do almost anything. They utilize their own full-scale
programming language, dubbed Robotic. If another object can
do something, a Robot can do it better. They can show
messages, fight the player, play music or sound, and do
countless other things. See the appropriate help sections for
more information.

Now you should be familiar with MegaZeux enough to where you
might want to change some of its options. Go open config.txt in
any text editor.  There is ample commentary to let the user
know how to change the options.  Make sure to remove the # sign
from any option you want set!

Editing the options can result in better sound, better
graphics, more fitting defaults, a more personalised Robotic
editor and more.

#IFYOUFIN.HLP
:1st:If You Find a Bug...

...we want to know! We're very interested in any problems or
bugs you find in MegaZeux. We also welcome any comments,
criticism, or suggestions. We especially appreciate QUALITY
MegaZeux worlds.

Email exophase@@adelphia.net if you have any bug reports. An
alternate would be to check the reports on DigitalMZX
(http://digitalmzx.net/forums/) to see if your problem has
already been addressed. Problems are listed in a thread called
"MZX 2.80 bug reports" in the General forum.

To make things sane for all parties, do this before submitting:
  1) Make sure you have the most current version.
  2) Make sure that the Bug Report thread doesn't address your
     bug.
  3) Try to write down what specifically happens.
  4) Try to pinpoint the problem to a specific Robotic line or
     MZX function; at the very least, try to narrow it down.
  5) Optimally, upload a world made in 2.70 that works in 2.70
     but does not in the current version to best isolate the
     problem.

#FAQ.HLP
:1st:Frequently Asked Questions

The following is a list of questions that have been received
through mail, E-mail, or messageboard posts about MegaZeux
innumerable times..

Q: I hate that MegaZeux is always windowed! Could you change
.  this?

A: There's already a way to switch between fullscreen and
.  windowed modes - press CTRL-ALT-ENTER.

Q: My Robot can't change its/the player's characters! I
.  use CHAR "A" but it turns invisible! What am I doing wrong?

A: Use CHAR 'A' instead. You MUST use single quotes
.  (apostrophes) or it will use the value of the COUNTER
.  A which is probably 0.

Q: How can I input a number that will go over 32767 or under
.  -32768 in Robotic?

A: You must encase this number in parenthesees, as shown here:
.  ~eset "largesse" to (4000000000)

Q: Can I distribute a world I made with MegaZeux? Is it
.  legal? Must I/can I include MegaZeux with it? Can they
.  be shareware worlds?

A: Of course you can distribute your worlds! That is what
.  MegaZeux is for! Please refrain from uploading worlds
.  that you made as a novice user if they contain only
.  built-in enemies, items, no plot etc. and ESPECIALLY if
.  only you have tested it. People will only yell at you. 
.  You should also refrain from using other people's engines,
.  char sets, modules and other files without the authors'
.  permissions. Get creative and make your game worth
.  playing! Please include any WAV, module, CHR, SPL, MZM and
.  all other files with the games, as well as a cohesive and
.  helpful TXT description file. Make sure that you include
.  MegaZeux on your webpage if you're posting it there, or make
.  sure to post to a large MegaZeux archive. Typically MegaZeux
.  worlds are freeware, but if you've made an assuredly epic and
.  ground-breaking game, then you can attempt to ask for
.  registration money in a shareware demo version.

Q: Can I use the music from Caverns in my games? How about
.  the music from the registered games? How about the SAM
.  files?

A: It'd be preferred if you did not use Caverns music in any
.  games you distribute, because Caverns music was ancient aeons
.  ago. The music from the registered games was illegal to
.  distribute; it's now under the GPL, but should be avoided for
.  the same reasons Caverns music should. The SAM files are
.  public domain and may be used as you please.

Q: Where can I get module files?

A: If you can't make them, search webpages for good ones.  
.  http://www.modarchive.com has a large tracked music library,
.  as do many CD-ROM collections. Another popular option is to
.  employ a friend to do it for you. If your game shows
.  exceptional promise, then an established tracker in the
.  community might make music for you. You will actually have
.  to... show real evidence your game is as good as its hype in
.  most cases, however. In any case, remember to give credit
.  where it is due (yes, even to yourself).

Q: What is some good software to create module files?

A: It's a matter of personal preference. Most people prefer
.  ModPlug Tracker, because it works well with Windows. Others
.  prefer to work with Impulse Tracker. Finally, a few are
.  still fond of Fast Tracker II. Be advised that the
.  DOS-based trackers like IT and FT2 might not work well with
.  an NT-based Windows system.
.
.  You Linuxites may want to try CheeseTracker or SkaleTracker.

Q: How do I make WAV files?

A: There are three easy ways to create WAV files. First,
.  you get recording software, a sound card, and a mike.
.  Hook 'em all up (read the instructions) and go for it.
.  Second, you can download them or get them from outside
.  sources. Third, you can take existing files and change
.  them with effects like echo.

Q: I need more than 256 characters!

A: Then you'll need to carefully utilize the Robot command
.  LOAD CHAR SET and ration your characters carefully. The
.  256-char limit is set within the world format and will
.  currently be left alone. Also, you might not REALLY
.  need 256 characters at once. If you're wanting more
.  characters because of heavy char use in animation, partial
.  char set loading will probably be the best solution.
>#PARTIAL.HLP:par:Partial Character Sets

Q: I WANT FUNCTION FOOBAR ADDED OR I LEAVE THE COMMUNITY
.  FOREVER :<

A: Before you go bugging the maintainer(s) of MegaZeux to add
.  new functions, consider these things:
.
.  1) Some things require massive work to implement. These 
.     things require changing the world format, and world
.     format changes are explicitly reserved for large version
.     number changes (in this case, for MegaZeux 3.00).
.  2) Some things have been purposely ignored because the
.     maintainer(s) deems these things not worth including. In
.     this case, it's probably best to pick up the source and
.     figure out how to add this function yourself.
.  3) You may not be the first to ask for any certain feature.
.     If you are not, then you'll often find out why a feature
.     is not implemented or, better, that it is going to be
.     implemented after all.  Either way, you learn more about
.     the feature and what would need to be done to include it.

#MEGAZEUX.HLP
:1st:MegaZeux Limitations

MegaZeux has to impose a number of limitations to insure
worldfile compatibility with MZX 2.x worldfiles.

$Memory Limitations

WAVs can only be up to 64k in size.
No single Robot, sign, or Scroll can exceed 64k in size
(including the global).


$Quantity Limitations

Item-      Largest number allowed-

Robots          255 per board plus Global Robot
Scrolls/signs   255 per board
Sensors         255 per board
Boards          250 per world
Local Counters   32 per Robot

$Theoretical Limitations

Board size maximum is 32767 x 32767.
Counter maximum is (2x10^32).

These will likely never be hit because these limitations will
only be met with a computer with several gigabytes of RAM.

$Other Limitations

Numbers less than -32768 or more than 32767 cannot be directly
used in Robotic. This problem is a worldfile issue and can be
circumvented by using a null expression.

Persistent file references (like initial board mods and custom
sound settings) must be 12 chars or less due to the
restrictions of the worldfile format. Filenames over this size
CAN be loaded and saved, but can only be used through Robotic
code.

No board can have a width of 256 chars because this corrupts
the board if it lacks an overlay. This problem is a worldfile
issue and widths set to 256 will instead be set to 257 
regardless of the status of the board's overlay.

#THEWORLD.HLP
:1st:The World Editor

Ready to start creating your own worlds? Then let's get
started! This section is a short editor tutorial, it will
teach you the basics of creating your own worlds.

To get into the editor, press E from the title screen. You
will be presented with a blank board with a small menu at the
bottom. You can use PageUp and PageDown to change the
currently shown menu, and you will be presented with various
keys and options. The mouse also works here. Feel free to
fool around with these various options. Press Alt+R to restart
and clear everything.

For your first world, you should start simple. The screen you
begin on is your title screen, so pick a simple name for your
game, such as "Redolent Obsequience". Move the flashing cursor
down a few lines and over a few spaces, using the arrow keys.
Press C and use the arrow keys to select an appropriate color.
Press Enter to select this color. Now press F2 to write Text.
Type in the name of your world, and then press F2 to stop
writing text. This screen will be your title screen.

Now you need to create the first board, or location, of your
game. Press A to add a board, then type in a short description
of the board, such as "Starting Board". Press Enter to go to
this new board.

Now you are free to doodle around. Use C to change the active
color. Use F3 through F9 to bring up menus of items, terrains,
and creatures. Selecting one with the arrows and Enter will
allow you to place it using arrow keys and space.

For example, press F3 for terrains, and select Line. (This is
a form of wall.) Now move around, placing walls. To ease
this, you can press Tab to toggle draw mode. When draw mode is
active, every move of the cursor will place the current
item/color. The current item and color is shown on the top
line of the menu.

Try to create a pleasing-looking screen, with walls, items, and
creatures. Some items will require that you set settings to
determine their behavior. To place the player's starting
position, move the cursor to the destination, press F10, and
select Player.

When you are done, press G to go to the Global Info screen. 
TAB to the Next button and press Enter. You will now be
highlighting the option "Starting Board". Press Enter, and
select the starting board (NOT the title screen in 99.9% of
cases) from the list and press Enter. Then TAB to OK and press
Enter. This tells MegaZeux which board you want the game to
start on.

You could now press Alt+N to select a module (music) file for
the board, if you wish. Then press S to save the world, and
type in a filename of eight or less characters. (The extension
of .MZX will automatically be added.) Press Enter twice to
save. Press ESC to exit the editor, and now you can play your
game! You can use L to reload your world in the editor to make
changes, if necessary. See General Editing Tips for more
advanced editing info.

>#GENERALE.HLP:1st:General Editing Tips
>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#GENERALE.HLP
:1st:General Editing Tips

The following is a list of important editing tips. They assume
you are familiar with MegaZeux's dialog box system, and that
you can navigate the editor's menus.

$Linking Boards

One-board games get boring REAL fast. There are three ways to
connect multiple boards. The first way is to add stairs,
doors, and whirlpools using the Transport (F7) menu. Then you
select a destination board. The destination board should
contain a similar transport, leading back. The two entrances
will now lead to each other.

Another method of connecting boards is with X, the Board Exits
dialog. Here, you can select boards that you will reach if you
walk off of the screen in a given direction. The destination
board shouldn't have anything in the way, and will not
automatically lead back- you must set the exit on that board
too.

The last way is to use a Robot to teleport a player via the
'teleport player "board" x y' command.  This assumes that you
are familiar with using Robots, but is the only way to go to
another board without having the player walk off-screen or into
a teleport.

To add boards, press A, or select (new board) from a board
list. To switch to other boards, use B.

$Board Sizes
:sizepos
You can change the maximum size, and the view position, of a
board, with Alt+P. Here you can move and re-size the view, or
center it on-screen.

You can also change the actual size of the board. The highest
possible size is 32767 by 32767, though a board that size would
require several gigs of RAM. Note that reducing the size of a
board will permanently destroy anything outside the new limits.

$Other Important Editing Keys

You can use Ins to "grab" the object beneath the cursor, or
Enter to edit it and then grab it as well. Use P to modify the
current object's settings. Use Alt+N to select music for the
current board, or turn the music off if it is already selected.
Use Alt+Z to clear the current board entirely. You can edit
important Board Options with I, and important Global (world)
Options with G.

:_A:  A - Add (board)

Press A or select (new board) from any board list to add
another board to the current world. You will be asked for the
name of the new board, and then a new board will be created.
The settings for the new board will be copied from the current
board, specifically- music, size, view, and the board info
menu. If you used A, you will now be spirited to the new
board. If you selected (new board) from a list, the new board
will be used for the setting, but you remain on the current
board. There is a limit of 250 unique boards per world.

:075:Alt+A - Select Char Set

Press Alt+A and select one of the three different character
sets. Select OK to confirm your choice. This will change the
character set to one of the three defaults. ASCII is the
default EGA ASCII character set. MegaZeux default is the
default MegaZeux character set. Blank is the MegaZeux default,
but with most graphical characters blank instead. Text, lines,
arrows, blocks, and certain other symbols are not affected.

:_B:  B - Select Board

Press B to change the current board by selecting from a list.
Selecting (new board) will create a new board and then select
it.

:073:Alt+B - Block

Press Alt+B to start block mode. Then move the cursor to the
opposite corner of a rectangular block, and press Alt+B again.
You can then select an action to perform upon the block. Copy
will allow you to duplicate the block by moving the cursor to
a destination and pressing Enter. The cursor marks the new
UPPER LEFT corner. Copy (repeated) will allow same as Copy,
but will allow copying the same block several times. Move will
allow you to move the block to a new location. Clear will
erase the contents of the block. Flip will flip the block
upside down. Mirror will flip the block left to right. Paint
will change the entire block to the current color. Copy
to/from overlay will copy the block to or from the overlay,
depending on where it currently is. Destinations for Move and
Copy can overlap the original block safely.

You can block copy to other boards now by going to the desired
board when prompted to pick the destination of the block. Just
press B and pick the desired board.

:_C:  C - Color

Press C to select a new current color from a menu. The thing
under the cursor is not affected.

:AltC:Alt+C - Char Edit

Press Alt+C to edit the character set. The character editor is
a separate section of the world editor and is discussed in
another section.

>#CHAREDIT.HLP:079:The Character Editor

:_D:  D - Delete (board)

Press D to select a board from a list to be deleted. You
cannot delete the first board (title screen). A deleted board
will be pruned out, with the next actual board taking its
place. A deleted board cannot be recovered.

:AltD:Alt+D - Default Colors

Press Alt+D to toggle default colors on and off. When it is on
(I.E. the option is highlighted in white) things such as Health
and Ghosts default to their natural colors. When it is off,
selecting things will not change the current colors. Default
Colors is on by default (yes, this has to be said).

:AltE:Alt+E - Palette

Press Alt+E to edit the palette (colors). The palette editor 
is a separate section of the world editor and is discussed in
another section.

>#PALEEDIT.HLP:093:The Palette Editor

:_F:  F - e

Press F to fill in an enclosed area with the current thing and
color. The area must be completely surrounded by things other
than the thing beneath the cursor. For example, you can fill
over a solid square of Fakes with something else. The current
fill command may not work right for very large and complex
areas- in this case, you must move to the unfilled areas and
press F to continue filling. This happens very rarely,
however.  Also, beware of trying to fill with an item with
limited placements like a Robot or a Sensor.

:097:Alt+F - Sound Effects

Press Alt+F to enter the sound effects editor. First you must
decide whether to use the default set of sound effects, or edit
your own. You can't edit the default set. If you edit your
own, you will be in a series of three editing screens. Use the
Next and Previous buttons to move between screens. Sound
effects, and the format used to represent them, are described in
detail in another section. The format is the same as used for
the Robotic command PLAY. (Digitized sounds are allowed here.)

>#SOUNDEFX.HLP:1st:MegaZeux's Sound System

:_G:  G - Global Info

Press G to enter the global info dialog boxes. The global info
options are covered in another section.

>#GLOBALIN.HLP:086:Global Info Options

:_I:  I - Info (board)

Press I to enter the board info dialog box. The board info
options are covered in another section.

>#BOARDINF.HLP:085:Board Info Options

:078:Alt+I - Import

Alt+I allows you to import a number of different file types
into the current board or world. You can import a board file
(MZB) unique to MegaZeux. You can import a character set file
(CHR). You can import another world (MZX) which is appended
to the list of boards. Unlike old versions of MegaZeux, all
exits will work. You can import a palette (PAL) file or a
sound effects (SFX) file, both unique to MegaZeux. Finally,
you can import an MZM file at a given position.

:_L:  L - Load

L brings up a list of worlds in the current directory and allows
you to select one to load. You will be warned if the current
world has not been saved yet.

:AltL:Alt+L - Test WAV

Alt+L brings up a list of WAV/SAM files in the current
directory. Selecting one will play it at a frequency of 420, or
middle C. This has no effect on the actual board or world.

:AltM:Alt+M - Modify

Alt+M allows you to modify the settings of the thing UNDER the
cursor. The current thing is not affected in any way.

:AltN:Alt+N - Music

Alt+N brings up a list of module files in the current directory.
Selecting one will select it as the default music for the
current board. If music is already playing, Alt+N will turn it
off. The music will still be selected as current even if it
doesn't fit in memory.

:AltO:Alt+O - Edit Overlay

Alt+O enters overlay editing mode. The overlay must first be
turned on within the board info menu. The overlay editing mode
is similar to the normal editing except only certain keys are
active, and the Enter and Alt+S keys have new purposes. The
overlay is explained in further detail in another section.

>#TOVERLAY.HLP:081:Editing and Using the Overlay

:_P:  P - Parameter

P allows you to change the settings of the current thing. The
thing under the cursor is not affected.

:084:Alt+P - Size/Pos

Alt+P allows you to change the size of the current board and the
viewport size and location. See another section for details.

>#GENERALE.HLP:sizepos:Board Sizes

:_R:  R - Redraw Screen

R will redraw the screen, erasing any junk or other problems
that may be on-screen. This option is rarely needed.

:AltR:Alt+R - Restart

Alt+R will clear the entire world. You will be asked for
confirmation.

:076:  S - Save

S will prompt you for a filename, then save the current world
as a MZX file. The save option will be highlighted if the
world has changed since the last save or load.

:082:Alt+S - Status Info

Alt+S will allow you to type in six different counters that
will be shown on the status screen within the game. This
allows you to have your own items that the player can collect,
and see how many he has. Counters are discussed in further
detail with Robots.

:AltS2:Alt+S - Show Level

Alt+S while editing the overlay will toggle whether the level
beneath the overlay is shown when editing the overlay.

>#TOVERLAY.HLP:081:Editing and Using the Overlay

:AltT:Alt+T - Test

Alt+T will allow you to test the current world, starting on the
current board. You cannot save or restore during this test,
but two "cheat" keys are active- F7 will fill your health,
gems, etc. to maximum, and F8 will destroy the eight things
around the player. Quitting will return to the editor.

:_V:  V - View

V will allow you to see the current board as it would appear in
the game. Use the arrows to Scroll the view, and ESC to return
to the editor.

:083:  X - Exits

X will bring up a menu where you can select exits for each
board direction. For example, selecting a destination board of
"City" for north will cause the player to go to that board when
he presses against the north edge of the current board. Boards
are not automatically back-linked- to make "City" lead back
here, you must go to that board and make a south exit back. 
Make sure the linked boards don't obstruct each other's exits,
and that they are of the same size.

:077:Alt+X - Export

Alt+X will allow you to export a number of different file types.
You can export a board file (MZB) unique to MegaZeux, good for
giving single boards to others. (The character set, palette,
and global info isn't included!) You can export the character
set (CHR) for transportation or to edit in Fontutil or another
third party app. Finally, you can export palettes (PAL) and
sound effect collections (SFX) for transportation, both of them
file formats unique to MegaZeux.

Other exports like partial character sets, MZMs, SPLs and other
miscellaneous files have to be exported via Robotic code. See
their respective areas for details.

:AltY:Alt+Y - Debug Mode

Alt+Y will toggle a red box in the lower corner of the screen.
This box shows, on labeled lines, the current position of the
cursor the current memory situation, and the presently playing
module. This information is quite helpful when programming
Robots.

:AltZ:Alt+Z - Clear (board)

Alt+Z will clear the current board entirely. You are asked for
confirmation.

:F1:  F1 - Help

F1 will bring up help on the current action. You can press F1
at almost any time.

:F2:  F2 - Text

F2 will toggle text mode on and off. When text mode is on,
Enter will go to the next line, and Backspace will delete going
backwards. All printable characters will type in as text.

:F3:  F3 - Terrain
:F4:  F4 - Item
:F5:  F5 - Creature
:F6:  F6 - Puzzle
:F7:  F7 - Transport
:F8:  F8 - Element
:F9:  F9 - Misc. (thing)
:F10: F10 - Objects

The above eight keys will bring up a menu of things to select
from. Selecting one will ask you to enter settings (if
appropriate) or choose a character for that thing. Then a copy
of that thing will be placed at the cursor, and will also
become the current thing. Scrolls, Signs, Sensors, Robots, and
Pushable Robots (all in the Objects menu) will be discussed in
another section. The current thing, color, and settings
parameter (p##) is shown in the upper left corner of the menu.
The settings parameter isn't important except for certain
Robotic programming situations.

:ShF1:Sh+F1 - Show InvisWalls
:ShF2:Sh+F2 - Show Robots
:ShF3:Sh+F3 - Show Fakes
:ShF4:Sh+F4 - Show Spaces

These four keys will flash on-screen the location of the noted
thing. They are good for locating "hidden" or camouflaged
Robots, passages, et cetera.

:Ar:Arrow - Move

The arrow keys will move the cursor. The edit window will
scroll when necessary.

:AltAr:Alt+Arrow - Move 10

Alt with the arrow keys will move the cursor ten spaces at a
time, or up to the board's edge if under ten spaces away.

:BkSp: Backspace - Delete
:Del: Del - Delete

These two keys will delete everything under the cursor. The
current thing is not affected.

:End: End - L/R Corner

End will jump the cursor to the lower left corner of the entire
board.

:En:Enter - Modify+Grab

Enter will modify the settings of the thing under the cursor,
if applicable, then select that thing as the current thing. It
is just like pressing Alt+M and then Ins.

:Enter2:Enter - Character

Enter during Overlay editing mode will change the current
character. Select it from a menu and then press Enter to
confirm your choice.

:ESC: ESC - Exit/Cancel Mode

ESC will exit the editor, asking for confirmation if your world
has not been saved. If you are in block, overlay, text, or
draw mode, ESC will instead cancel the current mode and return
to normal editing.

:Home: Home - U/L Corner

Home will jump the cursor to the upper right corner of the
entire board.

:Ins: Ins - Grab

Ins will select the thing under the cursor as the current
thing. The actual thing is not affected.

:Sp:Space - Place

Space will copy the current thing to the location under the
cursor. Trying to place something over a similar thing will
instead delete it. Placing something over a floor type will
actually place it OVER the floor, not deleting the floor.
Other things will be deleted if they are in the way.

:Tab: Tab - Draw

Tab will toggle the current draw mode. When drawing is on, you
will place a copy of the current thing every time you move the
cursor.

:PgDn: PageDown - Next Menu
:PgUp: PageUp - Previous Menu

These two keys will cycle through the different menus. The
menu bar can wrap around. You do not have to be viewing the
menu with an option before you can use that option- the menus
are purely for reference.

#CHAREDIT.HLP
:079:The Character Editor

The character editor is an important part of MegaZeux. With
it, you can change the appearance of the character set. For
example, you can make bricks, rockets, stones, and demons. The
default pixel resolution is fair- 8x14 per character for a
total of 640x350 for the entire screen. Other modes increase
colors at a cost of halving horizontal resolution, but the
difficulties of character editing in those modes is best
covered elsewhere.

To use the character editor, press Alt+C in the editor. You
will be shown a zoomed version of the current character, a menu
of options, a list of numbers, and a row of characters. The
numbers are only important for certain Robotic programming
situations.

To edit the character, move the cursor with the keys and use
Space to toggle pixels on and off. Use + and - to move one
character up or down through the character set. Use Enter to
select the current character from the entire set. The current
character is highlighted on the row in the upper right corner.

Use Del to clear the character. Use N to "negative", or
inverse, the character, turning all on pixels off and all off
pixels on. Use Alt with the arrow keys to shift the entire
character to one direction. Pixels shifted off of one edge
wraparound to the other edge.

Use M to mirror the character, flipping it left to right. Use
F to flip the character top to bottom. F2 will copy the current
character to an internal buffer, while F3 will copy the buffer
to the current character. The buffer is retained between uses
of the character editor.

Tab will toggle draw mode on and off. When draw mode is on,
every movement of the cursor will produce an effect. There
are three different draw modes, the current mode listed by
the word "draw". (set) mode will turn all pixels crossed to ON.
(clear) mode will turn all pixels crossed OFF. (toggle) will
toggle the state of all pixels crossed, from ON to OFF and vice
versa.

The character editor is a key element in creating decent games
with MegaZeux. If you can't seem to draw well with it, that's
okay, since it has awkward limitations. You can keep practising
at it, or you can get an MZXer friend to draw characters for
you.

The character editor changes somewhat in Super MZX modes - go
to the Super MZX Modes section for more information on this.

>#SMZXMODE.HLP:111:Super MZM Modes
>#EDITINGK.HLP:080:Editing Keys and Options Reference
>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#PALEEDIT.HLP
:093:The Palette Editor

The built-in palette editor can certainly spruce up a game. It
allows you to change the appearance of the 16 different
available colors. It is the only way to get a decent orange
color, for example.

To use it, press Alt+E in the editor. The palette editing screen
will appear. The current palette will be shown along the top,
with the current color marked. The RGB values of the current
color are shown along the right side of the screen, and the menu
is shown on the lower half.

Some color theory is in order here. Computer monitors display
colors by projecting various amounts of Red, Green, and Blue
light. Combined, these three colors can produce almost any shade
and hue of color. This is how colors are represented in MegaZeux
as well. Each color has a Red, Green, and Blue value, each
ranging from 0 to 63. 0 is off, 63 is full brightness, and the
other values range in shade.

To make colors other than red, green, and blue, you must mix
them. Purple is red plus blue, cyan is green plus blue, and
yellow is red plus green. (really.) Whites and grays are made
from equal amounts of all three. For example, red 42 blue 42
green 0 would be a deep purple, and all as 20 would be a dark
gray. To brighten a color, raise all the numbers, or lower them
to darken it. Orange is made with full red and 31 green.

Anyway, back to the editor. Use the arrow keys to select the
current color. R, G, B, and A will increase Red, Green, Blue,
and All, respectively. Alt+RGBA will decrease the same values.
Alt+D will reset the palette to it's default colors. 0 will
blacken the current color. Finally, F2 will store the current
color to an internal buffer, while F3 will restore the buffer
to the current color.

Note that in EGA mode, RGB values can only be 0, 21, 42, or 63.
Other colors will be shown as the nearest shade possible.

The default MZX palette editor will be unhelpful for Super MZX
modes; see the Super MZX section for details on working with
SMZX modes.

#GLOBALIN.HLP
:086:Global Info Options

To edit Global options, press G within the editor. This will
bring up various dialogs where you can edit options that affect
the entire world. The first dialog you see has the following
options-

$Death Board/X/Y/Mode

This tells MegaZeux what happens when the player dies. If mode
is Same position, then the player will simply lose a life. If it
is Restart board, then the player will also teleport to the
location on the board where he entered. If it is Teleport, the
player will instead teleport to the board and x/y location
stated in the above three settings.

$Endgame Board/X/Y/Mode

This tells MegaZeux what happens when the player runs out of
lives. If mode is Game over, then the game will simply end. If
it is Teleport, the player will be given one last life and then
he will be teleported to the board and x/y location stated in
the above three settings. Next time he dies, the game will end.

$Play Game Over SFX

If this option is on, the game over sound effect will be looped
when the game has ended and the Game Over message will flash
along the bottom of the screen.

$More

This button leads to another screen of settings.

$Edit Chars

:089:This button leads to a series of dialogs where you can edit the
characters and colors used to represent various internal things.

$Edit Dmg

:090:This button leads to a dialog where you can edit the amount of
damage done by various internal things.

$Edit Global Robot

This button allows you to edit the global Robot, which is a very
special Robot that is present at all times, although it is not
physically on every board. It is a very important part of
MegaZeux. See the Robotic manual for more information.

>#ROBOTICR.HLP:087:Robotic Reference Manual

:088:The second dialog of settings for global info has the
following options-

$First Board

Here is where you select which board will be the starting board
for the game. The player will start on this board. This defaults
to the title screen.

$Edging Color

This is the color of the border around the entire screen, where
the viewport does not extend. It defaults to dark gray.

$Starting/Maximum Lives

This is where you set the number of lives the player starts
with, and how many lives he can accumulate at any one time.

$Starting/Maximum Health

Same as above, but for health points.

$Enemies' Bullets Hurt Other Enemies

If this is on, then bullets shot by enemies, such as tigers,
will destroy other enemies that they hit. It basically turns
all Enemy bullets into Neutral bullets.

$Clear Messages and Projectiles on Exit

If this is on, the current message and all bullets and shooting
fire are cleared whenever the player leaves the screen.

$Can Only Play World from a 'SWAP WORLD'

If this is on, then the current world is unplayable in a normal
fashion. The only way to play it is to swap to it from another
world, using the Robotic command SWAP WORLD.

$Previous

This will go to the previous global settings dialog.

The character editing dialogs (there are eight of them) are
screens of characters and colors used to represent internal
things. Select one to change the color or character used. Use
Next and Previous to move between the screens, and Done when
you are finished. Lit Bomb Anim 1 is special, setting it will
set the other 6 frames of Lit Bomb Animation to the succeeding
characters.

The damage editing dialog allows you to change the amount of
damage dealt by various things within the game. Select one and
use the usual dialog keys to change the values, which can range
from 0 to 255. 0 will leave the player invincible versus that
thing.

Editing the global Robot is covered in the Robot tutorials, as
it is exactly the same as editing any other Robot. The actual
use of a global Robot is covered in the Robotic Reference
Manual.

>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#BOARDINF.HLP
:085:Board Info Options

To edit Board options, press I within the editor. This will
bring up a dialog where you can edit options pertaining to the
current board. The options are as follows-

$Board Name

This is the name of the board. It is mainly for reference;
However, the name of the first board (the title screen) is
also used to represent the entire world on a file listing.

$Can Shoot/Bomb

These options determine whether or not the player can utilize
shooting or bombs. If off, then the player cannot perform the
noted action.

$Fire Burns Space/Fakes/Trees/Brown

These options determine what fire will and will not burn
through. Space is empty space, NOT floors. Fakes includes fakes,
floors, carpets, and tiles. Trees are self-explanatory. Brown
is anything other than the player or a Robot/sign/Scroll that
is colored brown.

$Forest to Floor

If on, when the player moves through forest, it will become
floor. If off, the forest will simply disappear.

$Collect Bombs

If on, the player will collect bombs normally. If off, bombs
will be instantly lit when touched.

$Fire Burns Forever

If on, fire will never burn out. If off, fire will eventually
turn into ash, which is actually a dark gray floor.  Of course,
if fire is set to burn fakes, the ash will probably relight
immediately.

$Restart if Hurt

When on, any time the player loses health, he will be
teleported to the place on the current board that he entered
the board.

$Time Limit

If greater than zero, the player has the noted amount of time to
complete the board. The current time is shown in the lower left
corner during game-play. If time runs out, the player loses ten
health and the time limit is reset. This option is most useful
with the Restart if hurt option. The time is in units
considerably faster than seconds; test the board to get a feel
for the amount of time needed. The current time is reset if the
player exits and re-enters the board.

$Explosions to Space/Ash/Fire

This determines what explosions will leave in their wake- Empty
space, ash (dark gray floors), or burning fire.

$Can Save/Can't Save/Can Save on Sensors

This determines when the player can save his game. The first two
options are self-explanatory. Can save on Sensors allows the
player to only save if he is standing directly over a Sensor.
Sensors are explained in another section.

>#SENSORSW.HLP:094:Sensors- What They Are and How to Use Them

$No/Normal/Static/Transparent Overlay

This sets the type of overlay for the current board. No overlay
means just that- overlay mode is completely off. Normal overlay
is a normal overlay that Scrolls with the board. Static overlay
is a normal overlay that remains in a fixed position even when
the board Scrolls. A Transparent overlay is similar to no
overlay in that none is shown, but it allows you to edit it so
that one may appear later. Overlays are discussed in full in
another section.

MegaZeux has two types of sound- Digitized sound, played through
a sound card, and sound effects, which are emulated PCS effects.

MegaZeux's many sound options can be accessed via the config.txt
file. Please see this section for details.

>#CONFGINI.HLP:1st:The Config File

$Music files

Music files, referred to as MODULES, can be any one of the
following formats-

* MOD (or NST/WOW/OCT)

* XM
* IT
* WAV
* Other formats {S3M, STM, MTM, MT2, 669, ULT, FAR, MED (MMD0),
 DSM, AMS, MDL, OKT, DMF, PTM, DBM, AMF, PSM, J2B, UMX}

WAV loading as module is intentional but not recommended. Its
accepted use would be for a very short musical piece in WAV
form. Only GDM requires conversion. This is done on-the-fly
within MegaZeux and is not permanent.

$Using sound and music in your own games

There are three ways to utilize sound and music in your own
games-

. 1- Select default modules for each board.
. 2- Edit the built-in speaker sfx.
. 3- Use Robots to play modules, SAMs and WAVs, and speaker
.   sfx.

$Selecting default modules for each board

This is perhaps the easiest method to get music in your games.
Simply make sure that the proper module files are in the
current directory, and use Alt+N to select music for a board.
Press Alt+N to turn it back off again.

>#EDITINGK.HLP:AltN:Details on Alt+N

$Editing the built-in speaker sfx

To edit the built-in speaker sound effects, use Alt+F. The
format for them is discussed later in this section.

>#EDITINGK.HLP:097:Details on Alt+F

$Using Robots

Robotic has a large number of commands for playing modules,
SAMs/WAVs, and speaker sfx. A knowledge of Robotic basics is
required, so see the following sections to learn about Robots.

>#ROBOTSWH.HLP:1st:Robots- What They Are and How to Use Them
>#ROBOTICT.HLP:1st:Robotic Tutorial

$Format for sound effects

The sound effects editor and Robotic PLAY commands all use the
same format for playing sound effects. The format consists of
a single string of characters, each character representing one
note or command. Spaces are ignored, and capitalisation is not
important. A knowledge of music is required to use the format
effectively. The commands-

~A A B C D E F G
.  Plays the note stated, at the current octave and duration.
.  The scale starts at C and continues DEFGAB before going up
.  an octave. Use # and $ for sharps and flats, placing them
.  after the note.
~A # $
.  Sharps (#) or flats ($) the previous note. Does not affect
.  any note other than the note directly before the sharp or
.  flat. Constructs such as B# are allowed.
~A 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
.  Sets the current octave. Octave 3 starts at middle C. The
.  lower the number, the lower the notes.
~A + -
.  Raises or lowers the current octave by 1, but only if
.  possible. You cannot go below octave 0 or above octave 6.
~A X
.  Plays a rest of the current duration. A rest is a period of
.  silence.
~A Z T S I Q H W
.  These letters change the current duration of notes and
.  rests, I.E. the length of time each subsequent note is
.  played. Each one is twice as long as the previous one,
.  with Z being the fastest and W the slowest. Duration
.  defaults to Z. The counterparts to the durations follow-
.   Z = sixty-fourth note
.   T = ~AT~Fhirty-second note
.   S = ~AS~Fixteenth note
.   I = e~AI~Fghth note
.   Q = ~AQ~Fuarter note
.   H = ~AH~Falf note
.   W = ~AW~Fhole note
.  Duration (and octave) does not carry over from one string to
.  the next.
~A .
.  A dot will change the current duration to 150% that of
.  usual. This is a permanent duration change and will only
.  affect subsequent notes. Its use is similar to that of a
.  dot in regular music, except this dot affects multiple
.  notes.
~A !
.  An exclamation point will change the current duration to 33%
.  that of usual. This is a permanent duration change and will
.  only affect subsequent notes. Its use is similar to that of
.  triplets in regular music, except it affects ALL subsequent
.  notes.
~A &
.  & is a very special command. It is used to play SAM files
.  (digitized sounds) within a sfx string. It allows digitized
.  sounds within the sound effects editor. The general format
.  for & is as follows:

$"&FILENAME.SAM&3C"

.  This will play middle C using FILENAME.SAM. Multiple notes
.  are ignored- only the last is played. Duration is
.  irrelevant. 
~A _
.  An underscore is usually used in conjunction with &. It
.  basically turns off digitized sounds for the rest of the
.  string, and ignores the rest of the string IF digitized
.  music/sound is on. For example:

$"&SHOT.SAM&C_+C-C"

.  The above will play SHOT.SAM at frequency 428 (middle C)
.  if digitized sound is on, OTHERWISE it will play the normal
.  shooting sound of "+C-C".

$Sound effect numbers

The PLAY SFX command in Robotic plays one of the built-in sound
effects. The numerical values corresponding to these sound
effects are listed below.

#TOVERLAY.HLP
:081:Editing and Using the Overlay

The overlay is a rather simple but useful part of a board. If
you look at Floors and Fakes as a floor layer, and Walls as a
central layer, the overlay is a ceiling layer. Basically, the
overlay, when on, appears OVER anything on the board. The
player, enemies, Robots, etc. all move underneath it. The
overlay is purely for show and graphical effects. For example,
you could create archways that the player moves under, or have
a score and lives display that is overlaid over the view at all
times. (Using Robotic)

To turn the overlay on, go to board info (I) and set the overlay
to a mode other than Off. The editor will prevent you from
editing the overlay if it is Off, since it will not be saved
if it is. The available overlay modes-

Off- No overlay is saved, none is shown. Default for boards.
On- The overlay is shown normally, Scrolling along with the rest
.  of the board.
Static- The overlay is shown, but it does not Scroll with the
.  board- It always shows the top left position.
Transparent- The overlay is saved and can hold info, but is
.  currently not shown.

Once the overlay is on, press Alt+O in the editor to edit it.
This brings you to the overlay editor. The menu at the bottom
of the screen will change, and you will have access to the
following keys and options-

:074:Alt+B - Block

Press Alt+B to start block mode. Then move the cursor to the
opposite corner of a rectangular block, and press Alt+B again.
You can then select an action to perform upon the block. Copy
will allow you to duplicate the block by moving the cursor to
a destination and pressing Enter. The cursor marks the new
UPPER LEFT corner. Copy (repeated) is the same as Copy but can
allow copying of the same block to multiple places. Move will
allow you to move the block to a new location. Clear will erase
the contents of the block. Flip will flip the block upside
down. Mirror will flip the block left to right. Paint will
change the entire block to the current color. Copy to/from
overlay will copy the block to the main level from the overlay.
You will have to select the type of thing it will be copied as-
Floor, Text, etc. Save as MZM will save the block as an .MZM
file. Destinations for Move and Copy can overlap the original
block safely.

Like normal Block functions, one can now copy between boards by
selecting the board when the editor prompts the user for the
block's destination.  Use the B key to select the destination
board.

:_C:  C - Color

Press C to select a new current color from a menu. The character
under the cursor is not affected.

:_F:  F - Fill

Press F to fill in an enclosed area with the current character
and color. The area must be completely surrounded by characters
other than the character beneath the cursor. For example, you
can fill over a solid square of A's with something else. The
current fill command may not work right for very large and
complex areas- In this case, you must move to the unfilled areas
and press F to continue filling. This happens very rarely,
however.

:AltO:Alt+O - Edit Overlay

Alt+O will exit overlay mode and return to editing the main
board.

:AltS2:Alt+S - Show Level

Alt+S will toggle whether the level beneath the overlay is
shown. Without the level, only the overlay is shown, and no
board bits are seen through the holes in the overlay. However
it is a good idea to show the level to see how it looks beneath
the overlay.

:F1:  F1 - Help

F1 will bring up help on the current action. You can press F1
at almost any time.

:F2:  F2 - Text

F2 will toggle text mode on and off. When text mode is on, Enter
will go to the next line, and Backspace will delete going
backwards. All printable characters will type in as text.

:Ar:Arrow - Move

The arrow keys will move the cursor. The edit window will Scroll
when necessary.

:AltAr:Alt+Arrow - Move 10

Alt with the arrow keys will move the cursor up to ten spaces at
a time.

:BkSp: Backspace - Delete
:Del: Del - Delete

These two keys will delete everything under the cursor. The
current character is not affected.

:End: End - L/R Corner

End will jump the cursor to the lower left corner of the entire
overlay.

:Enter2:Enter - Character

Enter will change the current character. Select it from a menu
and then press Enter to confirm your choice.

:ESC: ESC - Exit/Cancel Mode

ESC will exit overlay mode. If you are in block, text, or draw
mode, ESC will instead cancel the current mode and return to
normal overlay editing.

:Home: Home - U/L Corner

Home will jump the cursor to the upper right corner of the
entire overlay.

:Ins: Ins - Grab

Ins will select the character and color under the cursor
as the current. The actual character is not affected.

:Sp:Space - Place

Space will copy the current character and color to the location
under the cursor. Trying to place something over itself will
instead delete it. Other things will be deleted if they are in
the way.

:Tab: Tab - Draw

Tab will toggle the current draw mode. When drawing is on, you
will place a copy of the current character every time you move
the cursor.

The basic method of editing the overlay is to use C and Enter to
select characters and colors, and use Space, arrows, and Tab to
draw with them. Do not switch overlay mode to Off once you have
drawn your overlay, or it may be permanently erased.

The overlay and overlay mode can also be changed using Robotic.
A knowledge of Robotic basics is required, so see the following
sections to learn about Robots.

#SCROLLSS.HLP
:1st:Signs and Scrolls in the Editor

Signs and Scrolls are a simple way to get messages across in the
game. To place them in the editor, press F10 and select Sign or
Scroll from the list. You must then edit the text of the Sign or
Scroll.

The Scroll editor is very simple. You can move the cursor among
the different lines and characters. Type to insert text
anywhere. Press Ins to toggle between insert mode (default)
and overwrite mode, where typed characters will overwrite any
characters already there. Backspace and delete work as normal,
as do PageDown, PageUp, End, and Home. Finally, use Enter to
start or insert new lines.

Press ESC when you are done editing your Scroll. It will be
placed at the current cursor position and will become the
current thing. Note that although you can now copy the Scroll
freely, there is a limit of 255 Scrolls and Signs per board.
This limit shouldn't ever be a problem, however.

:001:~AAttempt to overwrite board in storage

This is an internal error. It occurs when two boards try to
occupy the same slot. Try to isolate the reason for the problem
and notify the maintainer(s), as this error signifies a bug in
MegaZeux.

:002:~AOut of memory and/or disk space

You have no more RAM or hard disk space on the current drive. 
Clear up some memory and disk space before running MegaZeux
again.

:003:~AError storing current board

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage. This can also be caused by a bug in MegaZeux,
although this is unlikely.

:004:~AAttempt to load nonexistent board

This is an internal error. MegaZeux tried to load up a board
that does not exist. This error may signify a bug in MegaZeux.
If so, try to locate the problem and notify us. This error
could also have been caused when boards or worlds were
imported in a version before 2.80. Before 2.80, worlds
imported did not link their exits properly upon importation.

:005:~AOut of Robot memory

This error should never occur, as the total Robot memory is
unlimited. This error now signifies a bug in MegaZeux.

:006:~ALow on memory; Music code compromised

This error occurs when memory is VERY limited. No digitized
music or sound effects will be able to play.

:007:~AError accessing boards

This is an internal error. Try to isolate the reason for the
problem and notify the maintainer(s), as this error signifies a
bug in MegaZeux.

:008:~ANo available Sensors

You tried to make a duplicate of a Sensor in the editor, but
you had already reached the limit of 255 Sensors per board.

:009:~ANo available Robots

You tried to make a duplicate of a Robot in the editor, but
you had already reached the limit of 255 Robots per board.

:010:~ANo available Scrolls

You tried to make a duplicate of a Robot in the editor, but
you had already reached the limit of 255 Scrolls per board.

:011:~ANo available boards

You tried to add a board or import a world, but you already
had the limit of 250 boards for the current world.

:012:~AError saving world

This is caused by file errors or a hard disk space 
shortage. It can also result from an attempt to overwrite a
read-only file.

:013:~AError loading world

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage.

:014:~AWorld is from a more recent version of MegaZeux

The .MZX file you tried to load or import is from version 3.00
or greater of MegaZeux; at this time, version 3.00 does not
exist; however, this error message will alert you to its
existence if necessary.

:017:~AOverlay mode is not on (see Board Info)

You cannot edit or copy to the Overlay if it is Off; go to
board info and turn it to On, Static, or Transparent.

:018:~AError exporting board
:019:~AError exporting char. set
:020:~AError exporting text

This is caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage. It can also result from an attempt to overwrite a
read-only file.

:021:~AError importing board

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage.

:022:~ABoard is from a more recent version of MegaZeux

The .MZB file you tried to load or import is from version 3.00
or greater of MegaZeux; at this time, version 3.00 does not
exist; however, this error message will alert you to its
existence if necessary.

:023:~ANo files found to select from

You tried to select a file somehow (load world, restore game,
select module, etc.) but there were no files of that type in
the current directory. In cases where directories are listed, a
file box will be brought up with no files and a list of
directories.

:024:~AError importing char. set
:026:~AError importing world

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage.

:028:~AWorld is from version 1- Use conversion program

You tried to load a .MZX file from version 1.00g, 1.01, 1.02, or
1.03 of MegaZeux. In order to use these worlds, they must first
be converted to 2.51 format using the included VER1TO2 program.
Run VER1TO2 without any command line arguments and it will tell
you what to do.

:029:~AToo many boards- only partial import will be done

You are attempting to import a world, but that world's boards,
plus the boards in the current world, will total over 250
boards. If you select Fail, the import will be canceled. If you
select OK, the import will take place, but boards will only be
imported up to number 250.

:030:~AAll Sensors in use

You tried to create a Sensor in the editor, but the limit of 255
Sensors per board had already been reached.

:031:~AWindowing code bug

This is an internal error. Try to isolate the reason for the
problem and notify the maintainer(s), as this error signifies a
bug in MegaZeux.

:033:~AError loading save game

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage.

:034:~ACode/message is too large to fit into Robot memory

The Robotic line you just inputted will cause the Robot to
overflow Robot memory. Shorten the line or remove it. This
message indicates that either Robot memory is near full or
that the current Robot is close to 64k in size.

:035:~AAll Robots in use

You tried to create a Robot in the editor, but the limit of 255
Robots per board had already been reached.

:036:~AError importing palette

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage.

:037:~AInvalid "thing" for parameters

You used F4 in the Robot editor to enter a parameter, but the
word right before the cursor is not a valid thing, such as Gem,
Ammo, or CustomBlock.

:039:~AError exporting Robot

This is caused by file errors or a hard disk space shortage,
sometimes caused by TSRs or other programs not closing their
files. It can also result from an attempt to overwrite a
read-only file.

:040:~AError importing Robot

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space shortage,
sometimes caused by TSRs or other programs not closing their
files.

:041:~ALine too long to import

The file you were importing contained a line that is too long to
read in and translate. Shorten all lines over 200 characters and
try again.

:042:~AOut of memory for SAM

A SAM or WAV file couldn't fit into memory to play. This error
will not occur in normal game-play unless the debug menu is
active. (The SAM or WAV will simply not play.)

:043:~AMusic is off- SAM cannot play

A SAM or WAV file couldn't play because music is off. This
error will only occur in the editor or when testing games from
the editor. (Otherwise the SAM or WAV will simply not play.)

:044:~AError swapping to next world

A Robotic command, SWAP to WORLD, was issued, but the stated
world could not be found or otherwise could not be swapped to,
due to version conflicts, file errors, etc.

:045:~AAll Scrolls in use

You tried to create a Scroll in the editor, but the limit of 255
Scrolls had already been reached.

:046:~AError exporting palette
:047:~AError exporting .SFX file

This is caused by file errors or a hard disk space shortage,
sometimes caused by TSRs or other programs not closing their
files. It can also result from an attempt to overwrite a
read-only file.

:048:~AError importing .SFX file

This can be caused by file errors or a hard disk space
shortage, sometimes caused by TSRs or other programs not
closing their files.

:049:~AYou can only play this game via a swap from another game

This error occurs when you try to play a game that has the
option set to disallow normal game-play. The world can only be
played as a swap from another game. For example, this may be
the second half of another game.

:050:~AMusic is off- Module is set for board but not loaded

A module file couldn't play because music is off. This error
will only occur in the editor or when testing games from the
editor. (Otherwise, the module will simply not play.) The
module is still current for this board, however.

:051:~AError loading module

The module file could not be loaded, possibly because it isn't
a music type that MegaZeux supports. The file may also be
corrupted. This error will not occur in conventional game-play
unless the debug menu is active. (Instead the module will
simply not play.) This error will also occur if there is not
enough memory to hold the module file. A small amount of
memory is required to load a module.

:053:~AError loading SAM

The SAM or WAV file could not be loaded, because of a file
error, or it was too large. This error will not occur in
conventional game-play unless the debug menu is active.
(Otherwise, the SAM or WAV will simply not play.)

:055:~AError opening module file

The module file could not be loaded because there was an error
in opening it. Perhaps it does not exist in the current
directory.

:062:~ACannot overwrite player- move him first

In the editor, the player must always exist exactly once on the
current board. You cannot delete him or overwrite him with
something else. This warning is primarily in place to prevent
you from trying to overwrite the player with a Robot, typing in
a lot of code, then having the Robot just disappear since it
can't be placed over the player.

#SENSORSW.HLP
:094:Sensors- What They Are and How to Use Them

Sensors have two real purposes. The first is to act as save
points. The second is to interact with Robots as a type of
floor. The first use is simple... just set the board to "Save
only on Sensors," and then the player can only save when
standing on a Sensor.

The second use is more complex, and requires a knowledge of
Robotic. Sensors are like controllable CustomFloors. When
creating one, give it a name and a character, then enter the
name of a Robot that it will interact with.

Sensors interact with Robots using labels (messages) and SEND
commands, just like Robots interact with each other. Any Robot
can SEND a message to a Sensor, but the Sensor will only SEND
messages to the Robot stated in its settings. If you entered a
Robot of ALL, then it will SEND messages to all Robots.

$Messages TO Sensors

The following messages can be sent to a Sensor. A Sensor can
receive messages even when it is beneath the player.

~EDIE

This will cause the Sensor to disappear forever.

~ECHAR'X'

This will cause the Sensor to change its character to X.

~ECHAR###

This will cause the Sensor to change its character to that
represented by the number ###, from 0 to 255.

~ECOLORxx

This will cause the Sensor to change its color to that
represented by the code xx, a hexadecimal number from 00 to
FF. The color coding is the same as used for Robotic commands,
except without the c and ?'s are not allowed.

~EN
~ES
~EE
~EW

This will cause the Sensor to move north, south, east, or west,
respectively. If the player is on top of the Sensor, he will
move along with it. If the Sensor tries to move towards the
player, it will instead move beneath him.

$Messages FROM Sensors

Sensors will send Robots the following messages.

~ESENSORON

This is sent when the player steps onto the Sensor, or when the
Sensor is told to move and it ends up beneath the player, or
when something pushes the player onto the Sensor.

~ESENSORTHUD

This is sent when the Sensor is told to move, but it is blocked.

~ESENSORPUSHED

This is sent when something (not the player, of course) pushes
the Sensor.

$Notes on Sensors

Only the player can step onto a Sensor; other things will push
it. The Sensor, when moving, will move UNDER the player if he is
in the way, or will take the player with it if he is on the
Sensor.

#COMMANDS.HLP
:1st:Command Syntax

Commands in Robotic must conform to a certain syntax-

.  COMMAND [param] [param] ...

COMMAND is the words or symbol that specifies exactly which
command you are using. Params are the values used to supplement
the command's function-

~E"string" or "counter" or "label" or "Robot" or "file"

Strings are a series of characters surrounded by quotes.
Counters are strings representing the name of a counter. Labels
are strings representing the name of a label, a point within a
Robot. Robots are strings representing the name of a Robot.
Files are strings representing a file on disk, always including
the extension. Examples- "Hi", "Gems", "Label5", "*1230 +725",
etc. The quotes can be left off if the string contains no spaces
and is not the same as any word found in any command or
parameter, I.E. a word that the editor could not mistake for a
part of a command. For example, "Tooly" and "Drive" don't need
quotes, but "Ammo", "N", "Goto", and "You died" do.

~E#

Numbers are allowed to be integers within the range of
-2147483648 to 2147484647. They can also be represented in 
hexadecimal, using $xxxx format. In this case, xxxx can be any
number from 0 to FFFF. Numbers can be replaced with a string
representing the name of a counter at any time. Examples of
legal numbers- 3200, -79k, .$FA9, "Ammo".

Numbers can not directly be allowed to go past the 16-bit
limits (-32768 to 32767) in Robotic commands, but this can be
easily circumvented by using null expressions.

:col:~E[color]

The format for colors is cXX, where X is 0-9, A-F, or ?. The
first X represents the background color, the second X represents
the foreground color. The numbers and symbols represent the
following colors-

0 Black   ~0(color #0)
1 Blue    ~1(color #1)
2 Green   ~2(color #2)
3 Cyan    ~3(color #3)
4 Red    ~4(color #4)
5 Purple   ~5(color #5)
6 Brown   ~6(color #6)
7 Lt. Gray  ~7(color #7)
8 Dk. Gray  ~8(color #8)
9 Lt. Blue  ~9(color #9)
10 Lt. Green ~A(color #10)
11 Lt. Cyan  ~B(color #11)
12 Lt. Red  ~C(color #12)
13 Lt. Purple ~D(color #13)
14 Yellow   ~E(color #14)
15 White   ~F(color #15)
? Any color/No change in color

The use of ? is not always a logical option for some commands.
When used, it signifies to replace it with the current color or
ignore that part of the color for that command. Colors may be
selected from a menu within the Robot editor using F2. Colors
can also be replaced with the name of a counter at any time. In
this case, the value of the counter is BK*16+FG, where BK and FG
are 0-15. To use ?, use the following values-

.   256+FG = c?X
.   272+BK = cX?
.   288  = c??

A color of c?? will be inserted into commands when you have a
thing and you do not put a color as well. Examples of legal
colors- cF9, c02, c?5, c??, "Colored".

While detecting colors of ?? is generally an accepted practice,
it's extremely discouraged to change or put colors of ??.

>#BADPRACT.HLP:101:Robotic Usages That Should be Avoided

~E[char]

Characters are a single character surrounded by apostrophes-
'X'. X can be any character except #0. A character can be
selected from a menu in the Robot editor using F3. Numbers and
counters can be used to represent characters as well, with
values from 1 to 255. Examples of legal characters- 'a', '±',
20, "Count".

:dir:~E[dir]

Directions are used to denote a direction on the board. A
direction is one of the following-

.  NORTH (or N or UP)
.  SOUTH (or S or DOWN)
.  EAST (or E or RIGHT)
.  WEST (or W or LEFT)
.  IDLE
.  NODIR
.  ANYDIR
.  RANDNS
.  RANDEW
.  RANDNE
.  RANDNB
.  RANDB
.  SEEK
.  FLOW
.  RANDANY
.  UNDER (or BENEATH)

The four cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) are self explanatory.
Descriptions of the other directions-

~BIDLE

No direction, as in the absence of any direction. Used with-

Randomly any direction that the Robot is not blocked by
something in.

~BRANDB

Randomly any direction that the Robot is blocked in.

~BSEEK

The direction towards the player. If the player is on a
diagonal, it will randomly be one of the two directions
comprising the diagonal.

~BFLOW

The direction the Robot is currently walking in.

~BRANDANY

Randomly NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST.

~BUNDER

The direction signifying whatever is BENEATH something, such
as floors. Used with-

:_l1:~ALAYBOMB [dir]
:_l2:~ALAYBOMB HIGH [dir]
>#COMMANDS.HLP:con:Conditions

Most directions can be used with the following modifying
prefixes-

~BOPP

The opposite direction. NORTH becomes SOUTH, etc.

~BCW

The direction clockwise of the named direction. NORTH becomes
EAST, etc.

~BRANDP

Randomly a direction perpendicular to the named direction.
NORTH becomes EAST or WEST, etc.

~BRANDNOT

Randomly any direction OTHER than the given direction.

~E[thing]

The name of any thing from the editor, other than the player.
Use the name from the thing list, minus any punctuation or
spaces. In addition to the things on the lists, you can use
Lazer for any lazer walls shot by lazer guns or Robots. You can
use OpenGate for a gate that has been opened. Examples of legal
things- Gem, CustomFloor, LitBomb, Robot.

~E[param]

A code representing the settings for a thing. (see above) The
format is p# or p??. # is a hexadecimal code from 0 to FF. ??
represents settings that you don't care about or shouldn't
change. To enter parameter codes easily, use F4 in the Robot
editor after you have typed in a thing. p?? will be inserted
automatically any time you have a thing without a parameter.

~E[item]

One of the following- TIME, SCORE, GEMS, AMMOS, LIVES, LOBOMBS,
HIBOMBS, COINS, HEALTHS. Note the plural format- This
distinguishes items from things.

~E!<>=

A conditional for comparing two numbers or counters-

.= or ==     Equal to
.<        Less than
.>        Greater than
.<= or =<    Less than or equal to
.>= or =>    Greater than or equal to
.!= or <> or >< Not equal to

:con:~E[condition]

A word, sometimes followed by a direction, signifying a certain
condition, use in IF [condition] and IF NOT [condition] commands
to test whether a condition is currently present.

~BWALKING [dir]

Tests whether the Robot is currently walking in a given
direction. IDLE, NODIR, and ANYDIR are allowed here.

~BSWIMMING

Tests whether the Robot is currently in water.

~BFIREWALKING

Tests whether the Robot is currently in either lava or fire.

~BTOUCHING [dir]

Tests whether the player is next to the Robot in the given
direction. NODIR and ANYDIR are allowed here.

~BBLOCKED [dir]

Tests whether the Robot is blocked by something in the given
direction. NODIR and ANYDIR are allowed here. This condition
has a special mode- If the IF command has a REL PLAYER prefix
before it, it will instead check next to the PLAYER for being
blocked. If the IF command has a REL COUNTERS prefix before
it, it will instead check next to the position pointed to by
the counters XPOS and YPOS.

>#COMMAND2.HLP:pre:REL COUNTERS
>#COMMAND2.HLP:_r2:REL PLAYER

~BALIGNED

Tests whether the player is aligned with the Robot either
horizontally or vertically.

~BALIGNEDNS
~BALIGNEDEW

Tests whether the player is aligned with the Robot, but only
tests horizontally (EW) or vertically (NS), not both.

~BLASTSHOT [dir]

Tests whether the last direction the Robot was shot in was
the given direction. For example, if the Robot had just been
shot on the north side, then LASTSHOT NORTH would be true.

~BLASTTOUCH [dir]

Similar to the above, tests whether the last direction the
Robot was touched by the player is the given direction.

~BRIGHTPRESSED
~BLEFTPRESSED
~BUPPRESSED

#STRINGSA.HLP
:1st:Strings, Special Formatting, and their place in Robotic

Generally, a string is a series of symbols within quotes- "BUG",
"Hi there!", or even "ÅEA9 _±Ç". There are two special aspects
or features of strings that may be useful at times.

$Color

Used in Robotic commands *, %, ?, and &, strings can contain
color codes. There are two color symbols- ~~ for changing
foreground, and @@ for changing background. These should be
followed by one of these characters-

0 Black (color 0)      8 Dk. Gray (color 8)
1 Blue (color 1)       9 Lt. Blue (color 9)
2 Green (color 2)      A Lt. Green (color 10)
3 Cyan (color 3)       B Lt. Cyan (color 11)
4 Red (color 4)       C Lt. Red (color 12)
5 Purple (color 5)      D Lt. Purple (color 13)
6 Brown (color 6)      E Yellow (color 14)
7 Lt. Gray (color 7)     F White (color 15)

To show a ~~, use a ~~~~. To show a @@, use @@@@.

$Counters

Strings can show the values of counters, using the counter name
surrounded with &'s. For example, if the player has 55 gems,
"You have &GEMS& gems." will become, "You have 55 gems." If you
use &INPUT&, then the last inputted string will be shown. Use &&
to show a true '&'. The above features are available in ALL
Robotic commands that use strings, including in the name of
OTHER counters. This can be used to simulate array-like
constructs.

$Command Descriptions

:__3:~A* "string"

This command displays the given string as a message on the
message line, usually shown at the bottom of the screen.

>#STRINGSA.HLP:~A1st:~AStrings and Special Formatting

:__5:~A/ "string"
:_p1:~APERSISTENT GO "string"
:_g4:~AGO [dir] #

Use / followed by a string to move the Robot around the board.
The string must consist of a series of N, S, E, W, and I. NSEW
will move the Robot in that direction, and I will wait for one
cycle. One action is performed each cycle.

Use PERSISTENT GO in the same way as /. However, if the Robot
attempts to move in a given direction and it cannot, the Robot
will wait until it can before moving on to the next symbol.

Use GO to move in a single direction for a given number of
spaces.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:__6:~A:~A "label"

A : is used to denote actual LABELS within a Robotic program.
These labels are used as points within the program to branch
to when a Robot receives a message from another Robot, GOTO's
a label of its own, or otherwise receives an external message.
Label names can be any length and consist of any characters.
They are not case-sensitive.

>#BUILTINL.HLP:1st:Built-in Labels

:_g5:~AGOTO "label"

This will send the current Robot to the label given.

:_sC:~ASEND "Robot" "label"
:_sD:~ASEND [dir] "label"
:_sE:~ASEND [dir] PLAYER "label"
:_sB:~ASEND # # "label"

Use SEND to send another Robot to the label given. This is
called "messaging" a Robot, and the label given is the
"message". The target Robot can be given one of four ways,
as listed above respectively-

1- State the target Robot's name. Use "ALL" to message all
.  Robots.
2- State the direction of target Robot.
3- State the direction of target Robot, relative to the player.
4- State the x/y coordinates of target Robot.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:__9:~A[ "string"
:__2:~A& "string"
:__1:~A% "string"
:__8:~A? "label" "string"
:__7:~A? "counter" "label" "string"

Use these commands to bring up a "Scroll", or box-message,
during the game, containing the given text. The box-message will
contain all consecutive lines using the commands [, &, %, or ?.
Blank lines and labels will be skipped over. Description of box
message commands-

.  [ will simply display the given message.
.  & will display the given message, centered within the box.
.  % will display the given message, which can have color
.   codes.
.  ? will display an option, which, when selected, will send
.   the current Robot to the given label. If a counter is
.   included, the option will only be shown if the counter is
.   NOT zero.

All box-message commands can use ~~ and @@ color codes, EXCEPT
for [. The advantage of [ is that it will be clipped to 64
characters if it is too long, thereby preventing the display
from being screwed up. The other commands are not clipped and,
if too long, can mess up the display. (no permanent damage is
done- it just looks stupid.)

>#COUNTERS.HLP:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters
>#STRINGSA.HLP:1st:Strings and Special Formatting

:__4:~A. "string"

This command does nothing. It is used for comments and other
notes you may wish to make within your Robots. There is one
exception- If "string" begins with a @@. (see next)

:_4b:~A. "@@string"

If a comment's string begins with a @@, then the rest of the
string becomes the new name for the Robot. For example,
."@@hiya" would name the Robot "hiya".

:_e1:~AEND

This command ends the Robot's program. The Robot will not run
any further commands until an external event affects it.

:_d3:~ADIE
:_d4:~ADIE ITEM

These commands destroy the Robot forever. DIE ITEM will also
put the player at the location the Robot previously occupied,
which is useful for creating Robots that simulate items.

:_w1:~AWAIT #

This command will cause the Robot to do absolutely nothing for
a given number of cycles.

:_c9:~ACHAR [char]

This command will change the Robot's character (appearance) to
that given.

:_cC:~ACOLOR [color]

This command will change the Robot's color.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors

:_sF:~ASET "counter" #
:_sG:~ASET "counter" RANDOM # #

These commands set a counter to a certain value. Counters are
internal variables that can be changed through Robots. They are
usually used for custom purposes, although there are many
counters with pre-defined uses as well, such as "Gems". The
RANDOM version will set the counter to a random number within
the given range, inclusive.

>#COUNTERS.HLP:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters

:_iG:~AINC "counter" #
:_d1:~ADEC "counter" #
:_iH:~AINC "counter" RANDOM # #
:_d2:~ADEC "counter" RANDOM # #

These commands will increase or decrease a given counter by a
given amount. The RANDOM versions will increase or decrease by
a random number within the given range, inclusive.

>#COUNTERS.HLP:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters

:_i1:~AIF "counter" !<>= # "label"

This command tests to see if a given counter is equal to, less
than, etc. another counter or value. If the conditional is met,
the current Robot is sent to the given label. The following
conditionals are allowed- = Equal, < Less than, > Greater than,
<= Less than/equal, >= Greater than/equal, <> Not equal.

>#COUNTERS.HLP:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters

:_cP:~ACYCLE #

This command changes the Robot's speed to one command for every
given number of update cycles. An update cycle is how often
everything on-screen is updated, such as most enemies. Every
time a given Robot gets to run commands, is called a cycle in
terms of that Robot.

:_e6:~AENDLIFE
:_e5:~AENDGAME

These commands will end the player's current life or the entire
game, just as if the player died or lost.

:_w5:~AWALK [dir]

This will cause the Robot to move one space in the given
direction every cycle. Use a direction of IDLE to turn walking
off.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:_sM:~ASHOOT [dir]
:_sN:~ASHOOTMISSILE [dir]
:_sO:~ASHOOTSEEKER [dir]
:_sQ:~ASPITFIRE [dir]

These four commands all shoot a weapon in the given direction-
A bullet, a missile, a seeker, or a shooting fire, respectively.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:_t7:~ATRY [dir] "label"

This will have the Robot attempt to move in the given direction.
If it can, it will. If it can't, it will jump to the given
label.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:_b1:~ABECOME [color] [thing] [param]

The Robot will end its program permanently, and instead become
a specified object with a given color and parameter. Becoming
another Robot type will not destroy the program.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors

:_c2:~ACHANGE [color] [thing] [param] [color] [thing] [param]

All objects on-screen of the given type will become objects of
a new type. This command, if used too much, can slow down the
game.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors

:_pC:~APUT [color] [thing] [param] # #
:_pD:~APUT [color] [thing] [param] [dir]
:_pF:~APUT [color] [thing] [param] [dir] PLAYER

This will put a given object somewhere on-screen. The target
location can be given in one of three ways-

1- State the direction.
2- State the direction, relative to the player.
3- State the x/y coordinates.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors
>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:_d7:~ADIVIDE "counter" #
:_m8:~AMODULO "counter" #

Multiplies, divides, or modulos (rounding down) the value of
the given counter by the given value or counter. To modulo is
to set to the remainder when dividing. Example- 7 modulo 3 is
equal to 1, since 7 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1.

>#COUNTERS.HLP:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters

:_p2:~APLAY "string"
:_p3:~APLAY SFX "string"
:_w4:~AWAIT PLAY "string"

These all play a series of PC speaker sound effects notes. PLAY
SFX will only play if there are no other notes currently
playing, while PLAY will add its notes to the end of the
current sound effects queue. WAIT PLAY will wait until the
queue is almost empty before adding its notes.

>#SOUNDEFX.HLP:1st:Sound and Music

The Robot will go to the given x/y coordinates on the current
board.

:_lC:~ALOOP START
:_lB:~ALOOP #
:_a1:~AABORT LOOP

These three commands define a loop, or sequence of commands to
be repeated. LOOP START marks the start of a loop. LOOP # will
loop back to LOOP START the given number of times. ABORT LOOP
will jump out of the loop, to the command after LOOP #. The loop
count is kept in the local counter "loopcount".

>#COUNTERS.HLP:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters

:_m0:~AMOVE PLAYER [dir]
:_mA:~AMOVE PLAYER [dir] "label"

The player attempts to move in the given direction. If he is
blocked, and the command contains a label, the Robot will jump

The Robot becomes a pushable or nonpushable Robot, respectively.

:_i2:~AIF [condition] "label"
:_iB:~AIF NOT [condition] "label"

These test whether a given condition is present or not, and if
it is, the first will jump to the given label. If it isn't, the
second will jump to the given label. Conditions are covered in
another section.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:con:Conditions

:_i3:~AIF # # "label"

Jump to the given label if the current Robot is at the x/y
coordinates given.

:_i4:~AIF [dir] PLAYER [color] [thing] [param] "label"

Jump to the given label if the given thing is to a given
direction of the player.

:_iA:~AIF NOT [color] [thing] [param] [dir] "label"

Jumps to a label if a given thing is at the given x/y
coordinates or to the given direction of the current Robot.
The third form jumps if the thing is NOT in the given
direction.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors
>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions

:_i7:~AIF ALIGNEDROBOT "Robot" "label"

vertically or horizontally with the named Robot.

:_i8:~AIF ANY [color] [thing] [param] "label"
:_i0:~AIF NO [color] [thing] [param] "label"

If there are ANY of a given thing on the current board, jumps
to the given label. The second form searches for the absence
of the given thing. These commands can slow down your game
if used too often.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors

:_iC:~AIF PLAYER # # "label"

If the player is at the given x/y coordinates, jump to the given
label.

:_g2:~AGIVEKEY [color]
:_g3:~AGIVEKEY [color] "label"
:_t3:~ATAKEKEY [color]
:_t4:~ATAKEKEY [color] "label"

Attempts to give or take keys to or from the player. The
label-less forms will give or take the key if possible,
otherwise they will do nothing. The forms with labels will jump
to them if you try to give a key when they have no room for
keys, or you try to take a key they don't have.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:col:Colors

:_g1:~AGIVE # [item]
:_t1:~ATAKE # [item]
:_t2:~ATAKE # [item] "label"

Gives or takes a number of a certain item. The third form jumps
to a label if the player doesn't have enough of the stated item.

:_t6:~ATRADE # [item] # [item] "label"

Gives the player a number of the first item and takes a number
of the second item in exchange. If the player doesn't have
enough of the second item, jumps to label and has no other
effect. This command eases the writing of shops and vendors.

:_l6:~ALOCKPLAYER
:_l9:~ALOCKPLAYER NS
:_l8:~ALOCKPLAYER EW
:_l7:~ALOCKPLAYER ATTACK
:_u1:~AUNLOCKPLAYER

The first four commands lock the player, preventing him from
doing anything, moving north or south, moving east or west,
and attacking, respectively. The fifth command will clear all
locks on the player, allowing him free movement and attacking.
These have no relation to the Board Info options "Can Bomb" and
"Can Shoot". Player locking is local, only affecting the current
board.

:_b7:~ABOARD [dir] "string"
:_b8:~ABOARD [dir] NONE

Changes the board exit in the given direction to lead to the
given board or to nowhere.

>#COMMANDS.HLP:dir:Directions
>#STRINGSA.HLP:1st:Strings and Special Formatting

:_z1:~AZAP "label" #
:_rA:~ARESTORE "label" #
:__0:~A| "label"

ZAP will scan the Robotic program from the top down, changing
a given number of the stated label to a ZAPPED label. A ZAPPED
label is inactive- It cannot be jumped or sent to under any
circumstance. This has two uses- It will prevent interference
from a certain outside event, and it allows multiple instances
of the same label. For example, you could have five SHOT labels
in a row, and ZAP one each time the Robot was shot, and the
last one could lead to an explosion.

RESTORE will scan the Robotic program from the bottom up,
changing a given number of the stated label from a ZAPPED label
back to a normal label. Both ZAP and RESTORE can have a number
larger than the number of instances of the stated label. The
final command, |, is a ZAPPED label, allowing you to have labels
in your Robotic programs that are already ZAPPED and inactive.

:pre:~AREL COUNTERS
:_r2:~AREL PLAYER
:_r3:~AREL SELF

These are a special type of command, called PREFIXES. Prefixes
don't do a thing by themselves, but when placed before another
command that uses x/y coordinates, they change the origin of
the x/y coordinate system for that one command. REL COUNTERS
moves the origin to the x/y location stated in the counters
XPOS and YPOS. REL PLAYER moves the origin to the x/y of the
player. REL SELF moves the origin to the x/y of the current
Robot.

The movement of the origin changes the 0/0 coordinates from the
upper left of the board to somewhere else, effectively adding
that x/y position to any coordinates entered. For example, if
the Robot is at the 5/5 position and uses REL SELF on a 2/2
coordinates, it will effectively be 7/7. If the player is at
the 7/2 position and a Robot uses REL PLAYER on a -3/6 pair
of coordinates, it will effectively be 4/8.

Let's look at an example-

~EPUT c0E GEM p?? 5 5

This places a gem at the x/y coordinates 5,5.

~EREL PLAYER
~EPUT c0E GEM p?? 5 5

This places a gem 5 spaces to the right and 5 spaces below
where the player currently is.

~EREL SELF
~EPUT c0E GEM p?? -2 -3

This places a gem 2 spaces to the left and 3 spaces above
where this Robot currently is.

~EREL COUNTERS
~EPUT c0E GEM p?? 1 -4

This places a gem at the coordinates XPOS+1,YPOS-4.

Prefixes only have an effect on the very next command.

Prefixes also affect two other things- The built in counters
THISX and THISY will be offset by a prefix, and the command
IF [dir] BLOCKED will check next to the player or next to the
position noted by the counters, if a prefix is present. See
these for details.

:_r4:~AREL COUNTERS FIRST
:_r5:~AREL PLAYER FIRST
:_r6:~AREL SELF FIRST
:_r7:~AREL COUNTERS LAST
:_r8:~AREL PLAYER LAST
:_r9:~AREL SELF LAST

These prefixes are similar to the above prefixes, but they only
affect the first or last x/y coordinates in the next command.
For example, COPY accepts two pairs of coordinates. If you
precede it with the following-

REL PLAYER FIRST
REL SELF LAST

Then the first pair of coordinates will be relative to the
player, and the second, relative to the Robot. There is one
other difference with these commands- REL COUNTERS FIRST works
off of FIRSTXPOS and FIRSTYPOS, and REL COUNTERS LAST works off
of LASTXPOS and LASTYPOS.

:_j1:~AJUMP MOD ORDER #

The current module jumps to the stated order. For example,
JUMP MOD ORDER 3 will begin playing the fourth order in the
module, which is the fourth section of the module. Sometimes
your music editor will refer to this as 'Pattern' or 'Track'.

#BULLETTY.HLP
:1st:Bullet Types

There are three different types of bullets in MegaZeux- Player,
Enemy, and Neutral. The player shoots Player bullets, enemies
shoot Enemy bullets, and ricocheted bullets become Neutral
bullets. A Robot can shoot any type of bullet, according to its
BULLETTYPE counter, but it defaults to Neutral bullets. All
Enemy bullets become Neutral bullets when the option "Enemies
can hurt enemies" is set.

Player bullets can only hurt enemies. Enemy bullets can only
hurt the player. Neutral bullets can hurt either. Robots go to
different labels when shot with each one, or to a generic SHOT
label if there are none of the specific PLAYERSHOT, ENEMYSHOT,
or NEUTRALSHOT labels.

#CHANGECH.HLP
:1st:CHANGE CHAR ID- The CHAR ID Table

The Robotic command CHANGE CHAR ID has many uses. It basically
changes a character, color, or number from the Global Chars
or Damage tables from Global Info. The first number in the
command states what is to change. (note- if noted, the number
corresponds to a color or damage. Otherwise, it is a character)
These numbers are also listed next to things in the Global Edit
Chars menus.

Do not use any numbers that are not listed above- They may cause
strange things to happen in the game.

To change a character, use the following form:

CHANGE CHAR ID # [char]

.# is the number corresponding to the character that you want to
change, or a counter representing that number. [char] is the
character (or counter representing the character) that you wish
to change it to.

To change a color, use the following form:

CHANGE CHAR ID # [color]

.# is the same as above, but corresponding to a color. [color]
is the color or a counter representing the color that you wish
to change it to.

To change damage values, use a number or counter in place of the
[char] or [color].

After typing in a [color] or damage value, it may change to a
character representation, but the value will still remain the
same.

To change line characters-

Take the base number for the type of line you wish to change
(128 for thin, 144 for thick) and add one of the following
values to represent which sides are connected via other web or
lines-

0 -

replaced with the key to be scanned for. Characters A to Z and 0
to 9 work as expected. Other characters can be entered by
pressing F3 and selecting them from the grid, but they are not
all guaranteed to work. Shifted characters will NOT work, and
will actually scan as their non-shifted counterparts.

There are some special-case keys; ENTER is char 13, and the
function keys are as follows:

         F1 = 197     F6 = 192
         F2 = 196     F7 = 191
         F3 = 195     F8 = 190
         F4 = 194     F9 = 189
         F5 = 193     F10 = 188

Then again, it is recommended that you don't use the function
keys as they have special purposes in MegaZeux, such as the
quicksave/quickload features.

There is another way to scan for keypresses, using counters.

~EKEYENTER

This is sent When the player pressed the Enter key.

~EINVINCO

This is sent when the player grabs an energizer.

~EPUSHED

This is sent when a pushable Robot is pushed by something other
than the player.

~EENEMYSHOT
~EPLAYERSHOT
~ENEUTRALSHOT

One of these is sent when the Robot is shot, according to the
type of bullet used. If the appropriate label is not found, the
Robot is sent to SHOT instead.

~ESHOT

This is sent when the Robot is shot by a bullet and the more
specific label cannot be found.2

~EPLAYERHIT

This is sent when the player is shot. If not found, the Robot is
sent to PLAYERHURT instead.

~EPLAYERHURT

This is sent when the player is hurt by anything other than a
bullet. Bullets send the Robot to PLAYERHIT, and only send it
to PLAYERHURT if PLAYERHIT cannot be found.

~ESPITFIRE

This is sent when the Robot is hit with shooting fire.

~EJUSTLOADED

This is sent when the world was just loaded or restored from a
saved game.

~EJUSTENTERED

This is sent when the board was just entered or the world was
just started on this board.

~ESENSORON

This is sent by a Sensor when it is stepped upon by the player,
or the Sensor moves beneath the player.

>#SENSORSW.HLP:094:Sensors

~ESENSORTHUD

This is sent by a Sensor when it tries to move and is blocked.

>#SENSORSW.HLP:094:Sensors

~ESENSORPUSHED

This is sent by a Sensor when it is pushed by something.

>#SENSORSW.HLP:094:Sensors

~ELAZER

This is sent when the Robot is hit with a lazer.

~EGOOPTOUCHED

This is sent when the player touches Goop.

#COUNTERS.HLP
:1st:Counters, Built-in Counters and Local Counters

PLACEHOLDER

Counters are built-in variables, or stored values with names.
Each counter has a name, such as "Yellow" or "Apple Pies". A
counter can hold a value from -2147483648 to 2147483647, in
most cases. A counter is "active" when it has a value other
than 0. There can be a practically unlimited amount of active
counters at any one time, in addition to the built-in counters
(in reality it tops off around four billion). Counters retain
values between different boards.

Local counters, on the other hand, only hold their values for
one Robot. This is useful because local counters cannot be
written to by other Robots, only read by other Robots.

The following is a list of built-in counters, which all have
special meanings. There are three types of built-in counters-
Global, which affect everything, Robot, which are different for
each Robot and are only available to read by that Robot, and
Local, which are specific to the current board. Some built-in
counters are read-only; a few are write-only.

MegaZeux utilises a large number of built-in counters to
maximise flexibility. For this reference, they have been divided
into distinct sections.

$Player Counters
:ply:
~BGEMS, AMMO, LOBOMBS, HIBOMBS, COINS, LIVES, HEALTH

These contain the current number of the stated item that the
player currently has.

~BINVINCO

The number of cycles of invincibility the player currently has.

~BSCORE

The player's current score. Only use INC and DEC on SCORE if it
will ever exceed 32767. If you only use INC and DEC, SCORE can
reach over four billion.

~BPLAYERLASTDIR

The last direction the player moved- 0 for none, or 1 2 3 4 for
N S E W. Used to determine ice slippage and certain other
effects.

~BPLAYERFACEDIR

The direction the player is facing- 0 1 2 3 for N S E W. Used to
determine which player character to display.

$Robot Counters
:rob:
~BPLAYERDIST (read-only)

The distance from the Robot to the player, in spaces. The sum
of HORIZPLD and VERTPLD.

~BHORIZPLD (read-only)
~BVERTPLD (read-only)

The horizontal or vertical distance from the Robot to the
player, in spaces.

~BTHISX (read-only)
~BTHISY (read-only)

The current X or Y coordinate of the Robot. Affected by
prefixes- If a command that uses THISX and THISY is prefaced
with a REL PLAYER command, THISX and THISY will be generated
based on the player's current position. For example, if the
player is at 2,2 and the Robot is at 5,5, THISX and THISY
will be 3. If the player is at 7,7, THISX and THISY will be
-3. If a command that uses THISX and THISY is prefaced with
a REL COUNTERS command, THISX and THISY will be generated
based on XPOS and YPOS. Basically, THISX and THISY will be
set to THISX-XPOS and THISY-YPOS.

>#COMMAND2.HLP:pre:REL COUNTERS
>#COMMAND2.HLP:_r2:REL PLAYER

~BBULLETTYPE

The current type of bullet shot by the Robot. 0 for Player, 1
for Neutral, and 2 for Enemy. Technically, this counter can
hold any number from 0 to 255, but only 0, 1 and 2 have
definied behaviour. Use the others at your own risk!

>#BULLETTY.HLP:1st:Bullet Types

~BLOOPCOUNT

The counter used for looping commands in Robotic- LOOP START,
LOOP #, and ABORT LOOP. Each Robot has its own local LOOPCOUNT
counter.

>#COMMANDR.HLP:_lC:LOOP START
>#LCLCOUNT.HLP:101:Local Counters

~BROBOT_ID (read-only)

The internal ID of the Robot.

~BTHIS_COLOR (read-only)
~BTHIS_CHAR (read-only)

The current color and character of the Robot.

~BLAVA_WALK

Controls whether the Robot can walk on lava or not. Setting this
to 1 is the equivalent of using the BECOME LAVAWALKER command.
Setting it to 0 is the same as BECOME NONLAVAWALKER. Like
BULLETTYPE, this counter can hold any value from 0 to 255, but
only 0 and 1 have definied behaviour. This was a popular local
counter before the local counters were plentiful, as most
Robots didn't deal with lava.

>#COMMANDR.HLP:_b4:BECOME LAVAWALKER

$Board Counters
:brd:
~BTIME

The current timer value, between 0 and the time limit for the
current board.

~BTIMERESET

The time limit for the current board. 0 for no time limit.

~BSCROLLEDX
~BSCROLLEDY

The position of the top-left corner of the screen

~BBOARD_X
~BBOARD_Y
~BBOARD_COLOR (read-only)
~BBOARD_CHAR (read-only)

Set BOARD_X and BOARD_Y to the X/Y co-ordinates of a cell on
the current board, and BOARD_COLOR and BOARD_CHAR will
automatically hold the color and character values for that cell,
respectively.

One thing to note is that BOARD_COLOR takes transparency into
account. For example, if a white-on-black Robot walks onto a
yellow-on-blue floor tile, the Robot appears as white-on-blue on
the screen, but this counter will still report it as
white-on-black.

~BOVERLAY_X
~BOVERLAY_Y
~BOVERLAY_CHAR
~BOVERLAY_COLOR

These work in the same way as the BOARD_xxx counters above, but
deal with the overlay instead.

$Mathematical Counters
:mth:

~ABSn

Gives the absolute value of the number n.

~SQRTn

Gives the integer approximation of the square root of n.

~BMULTIPLIER

Counters that multiply or divide the temporary float value
before truncating in MegaZeux's trigonometry functions.

~BC_DIVISIONS

Determines how many divisions the base circle in MegaZeux's
trigonometric functions is divided.

~BSIN
~BCOS
~BTAN

>#SPRITES.HLP:spr:Sprites

$Super MZX Counters
:szc:

~BSMZX_MODE

Determines whether Super MZX mode is off, 1, 2, or 3.

~BSMZX_Rn
~BSMZX_Bn
~BSMZX_Gn

Changes the value of color n's red/blue/green value
respectively.

~BSMZX_PALETTE

Loads a Super MZX palette.  

$Miscellaneous Counters
:msc:
~BINPUT

The numerical value of the last string inputted.

>#COMMAND2.HLP:_iI:INPUT STRING "string"

~BINPUTSIZE

The size, in characters, of the last string inputted.

>#COMMAND2.HLP:_iI:INPUT STRING "string"

~BCURRENT_COLOR
~BRED_VALUE (read-only)
~BGREEN_VALUE (read-only)
~BBLUE_VALUE (read-only)

When CURRENT_COLOR is set between 0 and 15, the other three
counters contain the red, green and blue values of that color.

>#PALEEDIT.HLP:093:The Palette Editor

~BDATE_DAY (read-only)
~BDATE_MONTH (read-only)
~BDATE_YEAR (read-only)

Contain the current day, month and year respectively, based on
the system clock.

~BTIME_HOURS (read-only)
~BTIME_MINUTES (read-only)
~BTIME_SECONDS (read-only)

Contain the current hour, minute and second respectively, based
on the system clock, in 24-hour format.

~BCHAR_X
~BCHAR_Y
~BPIXEL

Set CHAR_X and CHAR_Y to a pixel location in the char set. You
can then set the PIXEL counter to one of the following to edit
the pixel:

  0 Turns the pixel OFF
  1 Turns the pixel ON  2 Toggles the pixel

You can also read the counter to see the current state of the
chosen pixel. A value of 1 denotes that the pixel is set, and 0
if not.

The pixel location system works on a 32 x 8 grid of characters,
exactly like the 'Select Character' grid. Each character
consists of fourteen rows of eight pixels, which gives us 256
pixels across by 112 pixels down. Since we start counting at 0,
the top-left pixel of the top-left character (char 0) would be
0,0. The bottom-right pixel of the bottom-right character
(char 255) would be 255,111.

>#CHAREDIT.HLP:079:The Character Editor

~BCHAR_BYTE
~BCHAR
~BBYTE

Set CHAR to a character (0-225) and BYTE to one of the fourteen
bytes within the char (0-13). You can then read or write that byte
using the CHAR_BYTE counter.

>#CHAREDIT.HLP:079:The Character Editor

~BINT
~BBIT_PLACE
~BINT2BIN

Used to manipulate bits within a counter. Set INT to the number
or counter you wish to edit. Set BIT_PLACE to a number between
0 and 15 (which correspond to all 16 bits in a counter), and
then set INT2BIN to one of the following to edit the bit:

  1 Sets the bit ON
  2 Sets the bit OFF
  3 Toggles the bit

The edited value is placed into the INT counter. You can also
read the INT2BIT counter to see the current state of the bit.

This method of bit manipulation is deprecated in favour of
expressions. Follow the link below to read more.

>#EXPRESS.HLP:1st:Expressions

~BRID<robot name>
~BROBOT_ID_<robot name>

Both of these give the robot_id number of the given named
Robot.

~BRn.<counter>       

Gives the value of the counter in Robot with robot_id number n.

~BVCHx,y

Allows reading and writing of single characters to the vlayer
with regards to coordinates x,y.

~BVCOx,y  

Allows reading and writing of single colors to the vlayer with
regards to coordinates x,y.

#USINGTHE.HLP
:1st:Using the Editor

The Robotic editor is quite simple to use. After selecting your
Robot's character and name, you will enter the editor screen.
There are three major sections to the editor screen- The top
box, showing current statistics; The middle box, showing the
Robot's program with the current line highlighted in the center;
The bottom box, showing the available editing commands.

To edit the Robot, you enter lines just as in editing Scrolls.
Use up and down or PageUp and PageDown to Scroll between lines,
and use Enter to insert new blank lines.

When you enter a line, it will be checked for proper syntax. You
will be told if the command fails syntax checking. If it passes,
it will be reformatted and redisplayed, and you can then enter
another line. The reformatting is unpreventable- Since MegaZeux
tokenizes Robotic lines to conserve space, all irrelevant
information such as extra spaces is lost. The editor attempts to
print the lines in a visually pleasing manner.

All lines other than the current line will have the various
elements such as strings and numbers highlighted in different
colors. Color codes will be shown as their actual color. The
current line is shown in a solid color and color codes are shown
in the usual cXX format.

The following keys are active within the editor-

>_a:F1    - Help
>_b:F2    - Color
>_c:F3    - Character
>_d:F4    - Parameter
>_e:F5    - Char edit
>_f:F6-F10  - Macro
>_g:Alt+Home - Mark block top
>_h:Alt+End - Mark block end
>_i:Alt+Esc - Unmark block
>_j:Alt+Enter- Block action
>_k:Alt+Ins - Paste
>_l:Alt+O  - Options
>_m:Alt+X  - Export
>_n:Alt+I  - Import

:_a:F1    - Help

Use F1 to bring up context-sensitive help at any time.

:_b:F2    - Color

F2 will bring up a menu of colors. Select one and press Enter to
insert a cXX color code into the current line corresponding to
that color.

:_c:F3    - Character

F3 will bring up a menu of characters. Select one and press
Enter to insert that character into the current line. No quotes
or apostrophes are added.

:_d:F4    - Parameter

If you have just typed in the name of a thing, such as Ammo,
F4 will allow you to select settings for it in order to insert
a pXX parameter code.

:_e:F5    - Char edit

Use F5 to insert series of numbers corresponding to character
pictures, for use with the Robotic CHAR EDIT command.

:_f:F6-F10  - Macro

F6 through F10 will insert short macros, customizable using
Alt+O.

:_g:Alt+Home - Mark block top
:_h:Alt+End - Mark block end

Alt+Home/End will mark the top or bottom of a block of lines.
You can then perform various block actions on these lines. The
marked lines are highlighted.

:_i:Alt+Esc - Unmark block

The current block is unmarked.

:_j:Alt+Enter- Block action

Allows you to perform an action on the current block of lines-
Copy it to an internal clipboard, Cut it to an internal
clipboard (copy it and then delete it), Clear it from memory,
or Export the block to a text file on disk.

:_k:Alt+Ins - Paste

Alt+Ins will paste in the block last copied to the internal
clipboard. The clipboard is preserved between Robots and even
between worlds.

:_l:Alt+O  - Options

Alt+O will bring up a dialog box where you can edit settings
pertaining to the Robot editor. You can change the values of
the five macros here. Use ^ for Enter in the macros.

:_m:Alt+X  - Export

Use Alt+X to export either the current block or the entire
Robot program to a text file on disk. You can then edit the
program outside of MegaZeux, or use the text file in other
ways.

:_n:Alt+I  - Import

Use Alt+I to import a text file into the current Robot. The
new lines will be inserted into the current program. Any
errors will stop the importation. This allows you to edit Robot
programs outside of MegaZeux. The import process may take a
while, so be patient.

The following Robot editor options can be changed through Alt+O-

~EMacros

You can change the text of the five macros here. Use ^ for
Enter.

~EShow Colors

If this is off, then color codes will always be shown in cXX
format, never as the actual color.

~ESyntax Highlighting

If this is off, then the program will not have different colors
for the various programming elements such as strings and
numbers.

~EUppercase

If this is on, uppercase will be used. If this is off, lowercase
letters will be used.

~EBase 10/16

If set to base 10, numbers will be shown in decimal. If set to
base 16, numbers will be shown in hexadecimal, in $xxxx format,
where xxxx is a number from 0 to FFFF.

The statistics line across the top of the Robot editor shows the
current line number, the current character within the line, and
the size of the Robot program versus the maximum size this Robot
can reach, based on remaining Robot memory and the 31k per Robot
limit.

Use ESC to exit the Robot editor when you are done editing your
Robot program.

:1st:Robots- What They Are and How to Use Them

Robots are the heart and soul of MegaZeux. Anything you could
want to do in MegaZeux, anything you see done in a MegaZeux
game, many things you didn't know were possible, can be done
with MegaZeux's Robots.

Robots are programmed in their own programming language, called
Robotic. Robotic is a fairly simple language to learn, 
somewhere along the lines of BASIC, although more complex. If 
you've ever used Epic Megagame's ZZT, Robotic is a considerably
more complex than ZZT-OOP, although it is similar and more
logical in style and syntax. There's a kludge or two to get
really powerful things working, but you'll get used to them.

To place a Robot in the editor, press F10 and select Robot, or
Pushable Robot if you want things to be able to push the Robot.
Then name the Robot, and select a character to represent it. Now
you are brought to the Robot editor, where you can program the
Robot in Robotic.

>#ROBOTICT.HLP:1st:Robotic Tutorial
>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
>#ROBOTICR.HLP:087:Robotic Reference Manual
#ROBOTICT.HLP
:1st:Robotic Tutorial

(note- if you've never used Robots before, you should probably
 print this out so you can read it while doing the tutorial in
 the editor.)

Robotic has a few concepts that you must understand before you
begin to program in it. You can skip this if you want, but it
will help you learn Robotic much faster. A large portion of this
will be obvious to anybody who has ever programmed in any
language or used computers extensively.

$Commands

You can have one command per line. A command is an instruction
to MegaZeux or the Robot telling it to do something. A program
is a series of commands, that are run right after another.

$Parameters

A parameter is the part of the command that can change, such
as numbers or colors. They specify how the command should be
run or what it should effect. For example, in the command-

WAIT 6

WAIT is the command, and 6 is the parameter. Many commands have
multiple parameters. Parameters are often specified using #,
"string", or [color] [char] etc.

$Labels

A label is a point in a Robotic program that has been given a
name. It is used as a reference point so the Robot can return
to that point at any time, to allow repeating sections of
commands, etc. Labels are written as follows- :"label"

$Messages

A message is something one Robot sends to another, or an
external event sends to a Robot, to tell it to do something.
That something entails jumping to the label corresponding to
that message. For example, a Robot can tell another Robot to
"Bounce"; That Robot will now be executing commands starting
at the label :"Bounce".

$Coordinates

X/Y coordinates are a pair of numbers representing a point on
the current board. 0/0 is the upper left corner of the board,
and the coordinates increase going down and right. You can find
coordinates easily using Alt+Y in the editor, or F6 in the game.
X/Y coordinates can be negative, but this is uncommon and used
for special purposes only.

$Strings

A string is a series of letters or characters, inside quotes.
For example, "STRING", "Booga!", "MegaZeux Rocks", or "[[]]".

$Characters

A character is a single symbol, letter, number, punctuation
mark, space, graphic, etc. All things are viewed as single
characters. When using single characters in Robotic, they must
be enclosed in apostrophes- 'X'.

$Colors

A color is a code representing a background/foreground color
pair. They follow the format cXX, where X is 0-9 or A-F. To
enter color codes easily, use F2 in the Robot editor. The exact
format of color codes is covered in another section.

$Directions

Directions represent one of the four cardinal directions of
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST. They can be abbreviated to N, S,
E, and W. There are other directions, but these are the most
commonly used.

Hopefully you understood the above material, as knowledge of it
is essential to program in Robotic. If you don't quite grasp
it, you can return to it later, but you will need to understand
it eventually.

$Your First Robotic Program: HELLO WORLD!

Firstly, open the Editor and create a Robot. Then open the
Robot's programming box by pressing Enter twice while the Robot
is highlighted.

Now, type the following into the editor:

.* "HELLO WORLD!"
.end

Here's what each line does.

~B* "HELLO WORLD!"

The * command puts whatever text is in the parenthesees on the
bottom of the screen. (Actually, it's the given message row
line, which is the bottom by default.) All Robotic code starts
immediately, so this particular statement happens right as the
board with this Robot is loaded.

~Bend

This ends the code. It is good practice to include the END
command even when you don't think you need it; leaving the END
command out can cause some problems such as text glitches or,
worse, the running of any and all code after where you want
your Robot to stop!

That was simple, wasn't it? Now let's step up to something a
bit bigger.

$Your Second Robotic Program

Create a Robot in the editor, and give it the following program-

.: "start"
.GO NORTH 2
.GO SOUTH 2
.GOTO "start"

Now test the world. As you can see, this program makes the Robot
move up and down. Let's analyze it line by line-

~B: "start"

As we know, this is a label. It marks the beginning of the
program.

~BGO NORTH 2

This quite plainly tells the Robot to move north two spaces.

~BGO SOUTH 2

This tells the Robot to move south two spaces.

~BGOTO "start"

GOTO tells the Robot to jump to a label. In this case, the
Robot returns to the label "start", effectively restarting its
code. This particular Robot will be executing these lines of
code for the entirety of the game.

Pretty easy so far, huh? You will probably find that Robotic's
basics are easy to grasp. Let's try something a little more
complex.

$Your Third Robotic Program

Try the following Robot program-

.: "loop"
./ "NNEESSWW"
.GOTO "loop"

.: "touch"
.* "Hello!"
.CHAR 'X'
.END

Testing will show you that this Robot runs around in a small
square. Now try touching it. If you can catch it, the Robot
will change to an X and greet you! Let's look at this program-

~B: "loop"

A label.

~B/ "NNEESSWW"

The / command tells the Robot to move along a given path. The
path is represented with a string of the letters N, S, E, W,
and I. NSEW represent the four cardinal directions, while I
tells the Robot to wait for a sec before continuing. Our path
tells the Robot to go north twice, east twice, south twice, and
west twice, forming a square path.

~BGOTO "loop"

The Robot will now return to the "loop" label, continuing in a
square path forever. Without an outside stimuli, the Robot will
never do anything else.

~B: "touch"

Another label, but this one is special. When the player touches
a Robot, by standing next to it and pressing against it, the
Robot is sent the message "touch". The following commands will
be run when the player touches the Robot.

~BCHAR 'X'

This tells the Robot to assume the appearance of character X.
Make sure that the X is in apostrophes ' and NOT quotes ".

$Robot Interaction

Let's get some Robots to interact with each other. Put two
Robots on a board, right next to each other. Name the left one
Lefty, and give it this program-

.: "dance"
./ "WWWEEE"
.SEND "Righty" to "dance"
.END

Name the right one Righty, and give it this program-

.END
.: "dance"
./ "EEEWWW"
.SEND "Lefty" to "dance"
.END

Now test this board out. You will see a silly pair of dancing
Robots, as they bump each other left and right. Let's examine
their programs more closely.

Since Righty has an END command as the first line, he isn't
going to be doing anything until told to. So we look at Lefty.
Nothing we haven't seen, until the SEND command.

~BSEND "Robot" to "message"

The SEND command allows one Robot to send messages to another,
telling it what to do. In this case, Lefty will tell Righty to
"dance", sending Righty to the label "dance".

Knowing this, the behavior of the two Robots should be clear.
Each one, in turn, moves away and back again, then it tells
the other one to do this. This repeats ad infinitum.

For a little practice, see if you can get them each to display
a message at the start of their dance step. Make the messages
different for each Robot.

$Some New Commands

The following Robot will demonstrate some new commands and
features. Make sure you put some ammo and bombs on the screen
with this Robot-

.END
.: "shot"
.COLOR c2C
.[ "OKAY, I GET THE POINT. I NEED MORE IRON"
.[ "...and now a liver transplant :<"
.END
.: "bombed"
.. "Check this out..."
.. "(editor) I'm not impressed."
.DIE
.: "touch"
.* "Watch out!"
.WAIT 10
.SHOOT NORTH
.END

Test this Robot out, bombing, shooting, and touching it. The
new commands and labels are explained below.

~B: "shot"

When the Robot is shot by a bullet, it is sent this message.

~BCOLOR c2C

This changes the Robot's color. The c2C represents Lt. Red on
Red. To enter colors, press F2 in the Robot editor and select
the color you want. The appropriate cXX code will be typed in
for you.

~B[ "OKAY, I GET THE POINT. I NEED MORE IRON"
~B[ "...and now a liver transplant :<"

The [ command is slick for a default. When encountered, all
the [ commands in the same area are put together to form one
long message, which is then displayed in a Scroll-like window.
It can be Scrolled and viewed by the player.

~B: "bombed"

When the Robot is bombed, or otherwise hit by an explosion,
it is sent this message.

~B. "Check this out..."
~B. "(editor) I'm not impressed."

Notice how this message was not shown in any way. The . command
is used for comments, I.E. messages that are not to be shown.
They are good for your own reference, so you know what you were
trying to do with this Robot, or so you can keep notes of
important things. Due to the loosening of Robot memory limits
it makes more sense to comment your code now.

~BDIE

Very simple, this command destroys the Robot forever.

~BWAIT 10

WAIT causes the Robot to stop and sit for an amount of time, 
the amount of time specified as a number. The time is in
cycles, which is the amount of time it takes to update the
board once, moving all the enemies and bullets, etc. Cycles
can vary in speed; the default is speed 1 (fastest) unless a
cycle command is placed inside the Robot.

~BSHOOT SEEK

The Robot will shoot a bullet in the indicated direction (in
this case, the direction the player is in).

$Conclusion

You now should know enough Robotic for simple programs. Even
more importantly, you should be able to scan the Robotic
reference manual, including the command reference, and be able
to learn many new commands. There are many important commands
in the command reference that we have not yet mentioned,
such as ENDGAME and GOTOXY. It is recommended that you at least
browse over each of the Robotic reference manual sections.

Make sure you (eventually) read over every part of the
reference manual, as there are many sections not covered in the
tutorials. Especially of interest will be advanced topics like
"The Vlayer and Its Uses", "Using MZMs", "Subroutines" and most
newer helpfile additions.

#BADPRACT.HLP
:101:Robotic Usages That Should be Avoided

There are several ways that one can devalue his/her code; in
general, clean and efficient code is the least likely to cause
unexpected errors as well as the easiest to repair. Listed here
are several practises to avoid, as well as proper replacements.

~cBAD: Creating anything with c?? or p??
.  Anything that has an undefined value has a possibility of
.  acting bizarre. The correct action would therefore to define
.  the object's color and parameter values.
~9GOOD: Putting in any set value for colors and parameters.

~cBAD: Using global counters for temporary or localised work.
.  There are several counters that are Robot-specific and don't
.  eat up global counter space. local through local32 per Robot
.  should be enough for almost everyone, and the local counters
.  can be read by other robots as well (using the r&id&.local#
.  counter).
~9GOOD: Using local counters for temporary or localised work.

>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#SUBROUTE.HLP
:sub:Subroutines

Subroutines are returnable labels, in essence. After the
subroutine actions finish, the Robotic goes to the line right
after the subroutine call. Anywhere a label can be used, a
subroutine can be called.

Subroutines are accessed by using the # sign as the first
letter. For example: ~egoto "#example"~f would call the
subroutine at the label "#example". To return to the next
command after the call use ~egoto "#return"~f.

In addition, one can go to the first subroutine's return
position using ~egoto "#top"~f.

A quick example of subroutines:

* "~fYE SHALL NOT PASS UNLESS YOU GIVE ME SPACE."
goto "#spacewait"
* "~fTHAT'S BETTER BUT YOU'RE STILL HERE. _CORRECT THIS_"
goto "#spacewait"
* "~fTHANKS FOR YOUR COMPLIANCE! YOUR PASS WILL ARRIVE SHORTLY"
end
: "#spacewait"
: "notspaceloop"
wait 3
if not spacepressed "notspaceloop"
goto "#return"

NOTE: Unlike older versions of MegaZeux, it is no longer needed
to initialise the stack, so don't get confused looking at older
examples of code and seeing odd statements like ~e. "#*-1-2-3"~f.
These statements are now treated as comments, and you should
mentally do the same.

>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#EXPRESS.HLP
:exp:Expressions

Expressions in MegaZeux allow users to set counters or a
displayed number to a mathematical expression. This possible
inputs are: counters, constants, or a combination. Any
expression in MegaZeux is bound in quotation marks and
parenthesees. For example, an expression adding 5 and 3 would
be done in MegaZeux by inputting "(5 + 3)". 

Counters can be used inside expressions using single quotes or
ampersands like so: "(&five& + 'three')". Single quotes are
recommended as MegaZeux cannot decipher nested ampersands and
heavy nesting can cause MegaZeux to have a hissy fit. 
"(&out(&in&)&)", for example, would cause problems while
"('out('in')') would not.

In fact, outside of simplifying mathematical code, nesting is
the big advantage of expressions. Nesting is limited only to
the amount one can put in a single editor line (~160 chars).

In expressions, the following operators may be used:

Binary operators (value-argument-value):

+  Addition
-  Subtraction
*  Multiplication
/  Division
%  Modulo
^  Exponent (a^b is a to the b order/power)
>> Bitshift right; it is logical, not arithmetic
<< Bitshift left
>  Greater than
<  Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
=  Equal to
!= Not equal to
a  Bitwise AND (not logical AND)
o  Bitwise OR (not logical OR)
x  Bitwise XOR (not logical XOR)

All of the either-or operators (i.e. "greater then" on down)
output 1 for true and 0 for false.

Unary operators (operator followed by value):

- Unary negation; returns the negative value of the operand
(two's complement). (-10) would return -10.
~ Binary negation; returns the bitwise NOT value of the operand
(one's complement). (~10) would return 5. (1010 to 0101)

Lastly, using a null expression "(n)" is the only way to
directly use numbers over 32767 or under -32768. This can not
be changed due to the way the world file format is coded.

#VLAYER.HLP
:vla:The Vlayer and Its Uses

The vlayer is an extra, global graphical layer (up to 32768
chars large), but it is never directly seen. It can only hold
character and color info. The vlayer acts like a workspace
allowing copying from/to overlay, copying from/to MZMs, copying
from vlayer to vlayer, reading/writing individual graphical
data to/from the vlayer, and reading strings from the vlayer.

Another important aspect of the vlayer is the ability to
reference a sprite to the vlayer.  This allows indirect display
of the vlayer through display of sprites. This can be
exploited to create the semblance of an extra overlay.

As for the vlayer's dimensions, it defaults to 256x128. If
these dimensions aren't adequate, the counters vlayer_width
and vlayer_height control its dimensions. Changing one will
make the other the largest it can be (if width was set
to 500, for example, height would be set to 65, for a total
workspace size of 32500).

To manipulate the vlayer, instead of using pure numbers in copy
commands, "#n" is used instead. For example, if copying a 2x2
block from 6,6 of the board to 0,0 of the vlayer is wanted, the
command would be:

~ecopy block 6 6 2 2 "#0" "#0"

Here are the vlayer copy functions:

Board to vlayer: ~ecopy block x1 y1 w h "#x2" "#y2"
Overlay to vlayer: ~ecopy overlay block x1 y1 w h "#x2" "#y2"
Vlayer to board: ~ecopy block "#x1" "#y1" w h x2 y2
Vlayer to overlay: copy overlay block "#x1" "#y1" w h x2 y2

In these, ~ecopy block~f and ~ecopy overlay block~f are interchangable.

Vlayer to MZM:
~ecopy (overlay) block "#x1" "#y1" w h "@name.mzm" m
Vlayer to string:
~ecopy (overlay) block "#x1" "#y1" w h "$stringN" c
Vlayer to itself:
~ecopy (overlay) block "#x1" "#y1" w h "#x2" "#y2"

There are several ways to give the vlayer working coordinates:

Pure numbers: "#xxx"
Counter value: "#&counter&"
Expressions: "#('counter' + x)"

MZMs can be placed on the vlayer by using p02. Example:

~eput "@visuals.mzm" image_file p02 x y

Reading and writing single characters or colors from the vlayer
requires the vch and vco counters.

For reading and writing characters use "vchX,Y".
For reading and writing colors use "vcoX,Y".

For example:

~eset "vch10,10" '+'~f sets the vlayer char at 10, 10 to a plus
sign.
~eset "vco10,10" 15~f sets the vlayer color at 10, 10 to white on
black.
~eset "temp" "vch10,10"~f sets temp to whatever the character at
10, 10 of the vlayer is.

Remember that the vlayer is global. If many vlayers are wanted,
liberal usage of MZM saving and loading will help to get around
this problem (though multiple MZMs may be needed if one vlayer
dimension is over 256 chars).

>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#TRIG.HLP
:tri:Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometry can simplify some complex engines, and MegaZeux
can access several trigonometric functions with fair precision.
Accessing trigonometric functions in MegaZeux requires some
setup, however.  

Because MegaZeux works solely with integers, you need to set
the counter "multiplier" to determine what the non-integer
working value is converted to. For example, if your function
has a value of .86602 and multiplier is set to 10000 the
resulting value would be 8660. Numbers are always rounded
down from their values.

Also, the counter "c_divisions" determines the precision of the
trig functions by determining how many times the circle is
divided. Common values for this include 360 (degree precision)
and 21600 (arc-minute precision).

The "divider" counter does what the "multiplier" counter
does for normal trig functions. This is extraordinarily helpful
for using the inverse trig functions, and using the same 
divider value as the multiplier makes interchanging use of
normal and inverse functions pretty smooth.

These are the trig functions MegaZeux can directly utilise.

sin - sine
cos - cosine
tan - tangent
asin - arcsine (inverse sine)
acos - arccosine (inverse cosine)
atan - arctangent (inverse tangent)

To use the counters you put the the unit number after the
counter name. Here's an example.  To display the cosine of 30
degrees in a degree-based precision, the needed line would be:

~e* "&cos30&"

>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents
#PARTIAL.HLP
:par:Partial Character Sets

Partial character sets are less than a full set, indeed, but
they only overwrite the characters they are told to. This
leaves the rest of the characters intact. Heavy animations and
changes that keep part of the character set intact (such as the
font) are two large reasons to use partial character sets.
There are three ways to save partial character sets.

~e#xxx prefix~f: This is for capturing characters from the
beginning of the char set. xxx is the size of the character
block you wish to save (in decimal), starting with character 1.
For example, #33initzone.chr will read chars 0 through 32 in
the current character set and save to the file 'initzone.chr'.

~e+xxx prefix~f: This is for capturing all charcters from a
user-specified starting point. xxx is the size of the starting
point of the file save (in decimal), saving all characters from
the start to 255. For example, +128halfset2.chr will read chars
128 through 255 in the current character set and save to the
file 'halfset2.chr'.

~e+xxx#yyy prefix~f: This combines both of the above methods. One
can save a char set of a specified size (decimal yyy) from a 
specified start in the current character set (decimal xxx).
For example, +170#28profile1.chr will save a 28-character size
block from characters 170 through 197 of the current char set.

To load partial character sets into your current set, you have
two options. You can firstly load it as you would a normal
character set; this replaces all charcters from the start of
the target character set until the end of the partial set.
Secondly, you can load the partial set into a non-0 position of
the target character set.  The @xxx prefix allows this; xxx is
the number (in decimal) of the first character to replace in
the target character set.

#NEWINVER.HLP
:1st:NEW in Version 2.80!

August 9, 2004 - First release, MZX 2.80 BETA

+ All ASM files have been rewritten to ANSI C compliant C++;
  this mainly involves the mammoth game2.asm.
+ Everything graphics related has been replaced with an SDL
  driven engine, including text mode rendering (also capable of
  rendering SMZX modes)
+ All keyboard and mouse events are now also handled by an SDL
  driven engine. All internal keyboard/mouse routines use SDL
  keycodes; no attempt was made to convert to MZX's old format
  at this level.
+ All world/board/robot loading and saving code has been
  entirely rewritten and is more modular now.
+ All robot handling code has been rewritten from scratch, and
  is more sane/efficient now (allocation, message sending,
  sensors, etc.)
+ All counter handling code has also been rewritten from
  scratch. This includes the functionality of builtin and
  "function" counters. It also includes a new string framework.
+ The robot interpreter has been almost entirely rewritten.
+ The main game playing code (game.cpp) has been almost
  entirely rewritten.
+ All module/sample playing code has been rewritten to use
  modplug and SDL. PC speaker effects are emulated.
+ The main part of the editor (edit.cpp) has been almost
  entirely rewritten.
+ The robot editor has been entirely rewritten, utilizing a
  modifed (fixed) version of RASM (released by me over a year
  ago)
+ All other source files (for instance, window handling code,
  scroll displaying, char editor, etc.) have been largely
  overhauled, some to more of a degree than others. At the
  very least, everything has been reformatted and made to work
  with the new systems.
+ key_pressed and key_code now return unsigned chars instead of
  signed, so if the game checks for negative values, it won't
  work. The same goes for reading back characters for strings.
- Some things that worked in the DOS version only worked due to
  chance, such as there being default (but valid) values for
  sprite widths or heights and thus sprites could be displayed
  before new values were set. They will not work here.
+ Boards may now be as large as 32767x32767. Please do not make
  boards this large. :)
+ You may now have up to 250 boards.
+ Boards may have up to 255 robots, 255 scrolls, and 255
  sensors.
+ There is no robot memory per board limit. However, individual
  robots may only be up to 64k large. If you include the global
  robot, this means that you effectively can have up to 16MB of
  robot memory per board.
+ The same applies to scrolls, which have separate memory 
  spaces and may only be up to 64k in length each (so you could
  have almost 16MB of scroll text per board, but who would want
  that??)
+ The robot stack need not be initialized, and will be
  dynamically resized as necessary (useful for recursion). This
  refers to lines such as
  . "#*-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8"
  at the beginning of robots. They're no longer necessary or
  useful (they will be ignored, like any other comment).
+ You may have a virtually unlimited number of counters active.
  The theoretical limit is some 4 billion. The effective limit
  depends on memory available.
+ The same goes for strings, which may now have any name, so
  long as it begins with a dollar sign ($). The same
  conventions regarding strings in 2.68+ still apply (see
  268_info.txt for more information)
+ Local2 and local3 no longer have dangerous side-effects.
  Local4 through local32 are also available per-robot now.
+ The following are now natively supported: XM, S3M, MOD, MED,
  MTM, STM, IT, 669, ULT, WAV, DSM, FAR, AMS, MDL, OKT, DMF,
  PTM, DBM, AMF, MT2, PSM, J2B, and UMX.
- You cannot click on help options to make it happen (for
  instance, you can't click on L:Load and expect it to bring up
  the load window).
- You cannot import or export ANS files. Use MZM instead.
+ You can now perform repeated copies by selecting "Copy
  (repeated)" from the block command window. This will cause
  you to repeat the copy indefinitely until you press escape.
  Also, after the first paste is made, you may press ctrl +
  direction to move in steps that are the size of the copy (you
  really have to try it to get a good idea of what I mean)
+ Press alt + H to hide/unhide the menu/information occupying
  the bottom 6 lines of the screen.
+ Right click is similar to pressing insert (grabs whatever's
  under the cursor)
+ Exporting char sets now gives direct options to set the
  size/offset for partial charsets. The old format (prefixing
  the name) will not work.
+ For saving files, you may make filenames larger and use mixed
  case (as opposed to all caps).
+ Now when you import worlds their exits will actually work.
+ Loading worlds results in all empty boards and empty
  robots/scrolls/sensors within the boards being removed. When
  you delete a board, you won't be presented with a gap in the
  board list anymore.
+ You may once again select ASCII as a default charset and
  revert to it in the char editor. You may also select a
  default SMZX charset.
+ Anywhere you can enter a line of text you can now press ctrl
  + left and ctrl + right to go to the previous/next word.
+ This isn't totally limited to the editor, but now everywhere
  a selection box shows up (such as for files, boards, items)
  you can press multiple keys to seek to a specific entry.
  Furthermore, in file selection boxes you can press backspace
  to go up a directory.
+ The SMZX char editor has been changed quite a bit. First, to
  use, you must be in SMZX modes 1-3 (toggle using F11). Within
  the editor, press keys 1 through 4 to change the "current
  color." You can place this color with space, and you can
  toggle repeated placement on/off using tab (sorry, no
  clear/toggle in this mode, they got in the way far more than
  they helped). You now move in increments of 1 char naturally
  instead of "half chars." Right click grabs the current
  "color" underneath the cursor.
+ You are now able to type invalid code within a robotic line.
  You will see that it's invalid due to the way the line is
  color coded. If you try to escape while any lines are invalid
  or if you press alt + V, a window will be brought up
  describing the nature of all erroneous lines. It will also
  let you mark each line to be deleted or commented out on
  exit. If all invalid lines are marked with anything besides
  ignore, you can exit safely. You may also mark invalid lines
  using ctrl + I, D, and C (to mark as ignore, delete, and
  comment respectively). ctrl + C may also be used to comment
  out a normal line, and then uncomment.
+ alt + O is still available, but you may only change macros
  here (see the config file for the other rarely used options).
  This does give you more room to modify macros, though. They
  may be up to 64 characters in length, and you may set up to
  around 45 or so in this window. (To get larger, you'll have
  to use the config file.)
- There are some slight discrepencies in robot size; if you
  highlight the last line then leave it it will register as a
  compilation of that line. Yet, when you exit, the line will
  be discarded, so this addition is not permanent. This
  shouldn't be problematic.
- alt + enter and alt + escape no longer work; use the
  alternatives (alt + b and alt + u)
+ Command line params have changed.
+ MegaZeux configuration information is now stored in a file
  called config.txt.

>#OLDERVER.HLP:099:New in versions 2.60 to 2.70
>#MAIN.HLP:072:Table of Contents 
#OLDERVER.HLP
:099:New in Versions 2.60-2.70
**NEW in 2.70***

+ Robotic code now loadable and savable to files, either to
  text files or compact but human-unreadable bytecode files.
  Other robots' code can be written to or read as well.
+ Defaults changed to more accepted values.
+ The swap world bug should be fixed. You should now be able to
  swap worlds back and forth with no trouble.
+ "atan" now works with any input/output value.
+ The "load_game" command now should work without any problems.
+ It should now be easier to compile MZX from the source.
+ Not really a bug fix, but the palette is now returned to its
  original colours.
+ Robots can now 'put' things underneath themselves; eg. put
  c04 carpet p?? under
+ The title screen menu now works; e.g. the menu you get when
  pressing 'Enter' on the title screen.
+ "key_pressed" now returns the twos-complement of the key
  value, i.e. the one used for :key?
+ The mouse can scroll across the whole screen after a screen
  refresh / transition to/from SMZX mode.
- When the board is set to a width of 256 and the overlay is
  off, the board will be corrupted. This cannot be fixed in MZX
  at the moment without a rewrite of the MZX world format.
  However, the overlay is set to 'on' by default now, so there
  should be no problems.

**NEW in 2.69c***

+ Sprite limit expanded from 64 to 256
+ New sprite flag added: sprN_ccheck mode 2
+ Vlayer added.  This is a virtual, unseen layer 32767 in size
  used to store graphical data.
+ World loading and saving through Robotic now possible.
+ Special class fwrite_modify; this allows editing of a file as
  opposed to overwriting.
+ File end seeking added.
+ Char file offsetting added.
+ File seeking added to editor

***NEW in 2.69b***

+ Fixed the fwrite_append problem RoSS mentioned
+ Fixed the string problem Nanobot mentioned
+ Added ridNAME as an alternative to robot_id_NAME
+ Added mouse_mx and mouse_my to determine mouse motion in
  "mickey" units
+ Added two local counters "local2" and "local3", local2 uses
  walk_dir and is_locked (so walking and locking will affect
  it), local3 uses last_shot_dir and last_touch_dir (so
  shooting and being touched will affect it)
+ Added the builtin string "robot_name" to determine the name
  of the robot invoking it
+ Reverted back to BWSB 1.20a again, in the hopes that it will
  alleviate swap world crashing a bit

***NEW in 2.69***

+ if "$stringN" = "literal" should now work.
+ Embedding && or () in names for save/load files for MZM
  saving and the like should work now.
+ Expressions won't be activated in pre-2.68 games, meaning if
  they used the constructs which would be valid expressions
  they should be okay.
+ More minutiae.
+ key_code, a more useful key_pressed alternative, added.
+ SMZX mode 1 returns.
+ SMZX mode 2 added.

***NEW in 2.68***

+ Expressions added.
+ Trigonometric capabilities added.
+ MZM file capabilities added.
+ Board and overlay can now copy block to each other.
+ Saving and loading of SAV files through Robotic added.
+ String commands totally redone.
+ Now, instead of using value/sqrt_value/abs_value you may use
  a value with the counter directly as such:
   * sqrtN
   * absN
+ fread_pos/fwrite_pos and page should work correctly now; when
  you increase the pos it should bump up the page too.
+ pixel_x, pixel_y, char were broken in 2.65; fixed in 2.68
+ strings had some bugs in 2.62b+, should be fixed now because
  of a seperate implementation.
+ MZX Robot files are now saved to save files; so if you have a
  read and/or write file open and the game is saved, if the
  game is loaded the file will be restored at the position it
  was at.

***NEW in 2.65***

New features:
+ Shows current mod playing in debug window
+ Misc new counters: (ro = read only, wo = write only)
 * fread_counter (ro), fwrite_counter (wo): reads/writes a full
   counter from file
 * board_w (ro), board_h (ro): returns current board
   width/height
 * robot_id_(name) (ro): returns the ID number of robot "name"
 * r(number).(counter) (ro): returns the value of the local
   counter for the robot with the given ID. Note that you
   cannot write to another robot's counter.
+ You can now save partial charsets in the editor.
+ Sprites added; limit set at 64 global.
+ Counters now representable in hex.
+ Subroutines added.

***NEW in 2.62***

~FStrings

MZX 2.62 has 10 strings. They are referenced as such:

~B$string0
~B$string1
...
~B$string9

Note that they use up actual counter namespace, so if you use
over 1000 counters you'll probably overwrite the strings.

~FSetting strings

You can set a string to eight things, in the format of
~Bset $stringN to PARAMETER
where N is the number of the string and PARAMETER is one of
the following:

~BINPUT
The value taken from the "input string" command.

~BBOARD_NAME
The name of the current board.

~BBOARD_SCAN
A string scanned in from the board directly.
Its coordinates are Board_x, Board_y and the string is
terminated by an asterisk (*)

For example, with a board that has "my string*" at 10, 10:
set "Board_x" 10
set "Board_y" 10
set "$string0" "BOARD_SCAN"
Will scan "my string" into $string0.

~BFWRITE
This does not actually set the string to anything, but will
write the string to the currently open write file.

~BFREAD
Will read the string in from the currently open read file.

~B"string"
Will set the string to a literal string, for example:
~Bset "$string0" "hello!"

~B"$string"
Will set the string to another string.

~B(number)
Will set the string to an integer value.

~FOutputting strings

You can output strings in anywhere where MZX supports strings,
within ampersands. For instance:

set "$string0" "Test"
write overlay c0f 0 0 "&$string0&"

Will write "Test" at 0, 0 in the overlay.

As mentioned above, you can "set" a string to FWRITE to output it
to the current write file.

~FComparing strings

You can use the "if" command with a string, with either another
string, a string literal, or a number. Note that the string must
be the first paramter, and that you can not use input, board_scan,
etc (load them into another string then compare). Also note that
you can only use equality (=) or inequality. Any other comparisons
will always be FALSE (if you don't like this, blame Greg's limitted
str_cmp function :p)

Example:
input string "Give me a string."
set "$string0" "Input"
if "$string0" = "Bob" "Okay"
end 

~FOther new features
The "mod_order" counter will report the current order (that is,
patter) the playing module is at. Used in conjunction with
the jump mod order command it can be used to save/restore a mod
position between boards...

~FNotes/Bugs

- MZX 2.62 files are no longer forward compatible. That means that
  a file made in MZX 2.62 will NOT work in any previous versions
  (but it WILL work in future versions, so long as they set the
  version string correctly)

- The string reading from files may not work correctly on the first
  read (that is, it might truncate the first character of the string)
  For this reason I suggest putting a junk string in the first part
  of the file and reading it first.

~E2.61 release:

   This is a bug fix release.

FIXES :

-Games speeds have been normalized
-Password protection has been fully removed! Instead of spiders
 half way hack.
-Original startup color scheme implemented!
-Redocumentation of a few features left undocumented.

:100:New in versions 2.01 to 2.60
 
~E2.60 release:

 More than anything else this version bends the spin
off versions of mzx back into line with the original. Instead
of being a new mzx that some people use and other's dont, this,
I hope, will be a standard. And hopefully this code will be
used for future versions of mzx.

NEW FEATURES :

 Check out the builtin-counter section for the complete
run down of these new and exciting mzx features-

File access
Menu activation/deactivation
Current key pressed detection
Easy access to all 16 bits of a counter
Pixel editing of a char set
Single Byte editing of a char.
Real player distance

Also check the builtin-labels section for more on the :"key?"
lable.

REMOVALS :

SMZX (may return if I can get it not to screw up the mouse)
inter robot targeting (no one uses this)
Random color start up (It's Ugly as sin)

$****

$~ENEW in version 2.51- ALL NEW music/sound code! 32-channels;
$~Ebug-free; support for stereo, 16-bit, GUS, and PAS-16;
$~Esupport for many formats and effects; up to four
$~Esimultaneous sound effects!

Note that the new music support requires that you CONVERT all
non-MOD files using the included program, 2GDM. See 'MegaZeux's
Sound System' for details on the NEW music system.

>#SOUNDEFX.HLP:1st:MegaZeux's Sound System

Note- This is a direct translation from the file WHATSNEW.251,
included with MegaZeux. If you haven't used version 1.03 or
before, you probably won't understand much of this list.

. + Screen shot saving rotates file name(starts with screen0.pcx)
. + Fixed bug involving incorrect loading of mzx health etc.

~E2.51s3final release:

. + Fixed bug involving mod * settings being lost when loading
. + Should have fixed ems problems some were reporting, if not,
. just try to get more conventional memory. Enclosed document
. (convmem.txt) should help you.
. + Fixed a bug involving direction checking.
. + Pressing ']' at most any time will now save a screenshot to
.  screen.pcx
. + Pressing alt+8 in the editor will set the current mod to *.


~E2.5.1s2beta release:

. + Added MOD "*", which allows a board to use whatever module
.  the previous board was using; this necessitated a change in
.  the .SAV file format (still need changes in the editor UI
.  to access this feature outside of Robotic)
. + inmate's semantics for MOD "SOMETHIN.MOD*" aren't
.  immediately possible, although a rough hack is in already
. + char edits are now not displayed until the beginning of the
.  next cycle; the deferred display should eliminate a lot of
.  flickering
. + an (at least partial) fix for the infamous UNDER bug 
. + MOUSEX, MOUSEY and BUTTONS are now buffered.
. + more sane magic handling
. + can load MZX 2.51 and 2.51S1 worlds, but will only save

~E2.51s1beta release:

. + Increased counters to 1000.
. + Added following counters: (ro) is read only, (r&w) is read +
.   write
.   * (r&w) MOUSEX, MOUSEY - Location of mouse cursor over the
.     screen.
.   * (ro)  BUTTONS - Status of the buttons (none=0,left=1,
.     right=2,both=3)
.   * (ro)  MBOARDX, MBOARDy - Location of mouse cursor over the
.     board.
.   * (ro)  SCROLLEDX, SCROLLEDY - Length the screen has been
.     scrolled in each direction.
.   * (ro)  PLAYERX, PLAYERY - Location of the player
.   * (r&w) CURSORSTATE - Turns on & off the hardware cursor
.     (0= off, 1= on, 0 default)
. + Added new independant counter like LOOPCOUNT, named LOCAL,
.   it's now possible for a robot to search the screen or
.   something without wasting a counter.
. + New .MZX and .SAV formats for MZX2.51S1.
. + .SAV files from 2.51S1 are incompatible with 2.51, and
.   vice-versa
. + 2.51S1 is capable of loading 2.51 .MZX world files.
. - 2.51 is not capable of loading .MZX files created or opened &
.   saved in 2.51S1

~ENew in version 2.51: (quick fix before I do 3.00!)

. * Bug where moving north or west towards a board that is
.  larger than 100 tiles in a dimension may not work properly
.  fixed.
. * Bugs in 2GDM.EXE preventing proper conversion of some S3Ms
.  fixed.
. * A rare bug preventing internal MOD conversion fixed.
. * "Error opening MOD" will no longer appear during normal
.  gameplay.
. * Exporting ANSis now adds a color to the end returning text
.  to normal grey.

~ENew in version 2.50:

. * FOR ALL YOU 2.07 USERS- THE MAJOR UPGRADE is the new sound
.  code! Support for stereo, 16-bit, more cards, 4 sound
.  effects channels, 32 music channels, higher quality, and
.  faster sound code! Less bugs! More formats supported! All
.  non-MOD files MUST be converted to GDM using the included
.  2GDM.EXE program. Formats supported- MOD (up to 32 channels),
.  WOW/OCT/NST, S3M, 669, and MTM.

. * Volume controls (overall and SAM) added to F2-Settings (saved
.  in .CFG file)
. * SAMs play at 2x volume.
. * MTM support added to 2GDM.EXE. Other formats aren't added
.  because they aren't needed (not used often enough) or in the
.  case of XM, because they support too many advanced features
.  that MZX does not support. Partial XM support MAY be added
.  later.
. * Many minor bug fixes in 2GDM.EXE's conversion routines.
. * Internal MOD conversion (in MegaZeux) sped up considerably.
. * For all those that upgraded from 2.07, see 2.49g and 2.48b
.  WHATS-NEW for more stuff, including a couple interesting
.  new Robotic features

~ENew in version 2.49g-

. * New Import function added- You can import an ANSi to any
.  position on the board.
. * Full SAM sound effect support as in the original 2.07 version
.  (but using the new MOD code for up to 4 simultaneous
.  channels)
. * The OPEN Robotic command will now push the Robot out of the
.  way if the door would be blocked by the robot.
. * REL PLAYER and REL COUNTERS now affects the THISX/THISY
.  counters (giving the distance FROM the player/counters TO
.  the Robot) and the prefixes also affect the IF [dir] BLOCKED
.  command, allowing you to check for blocked status next to
.  the player or an arbitrary position.
. * [ box message statements now clip their message to 64
.  characters (the maximum) on display. Note that all other
.  box-message statements are NOT clipped!
. * Color codes are allowed in ? and & box message statements
. * Invalid sound card settings no longer cause a lock-up
. * You can hold down the mouse button to cycle through RGB
.  values in the palette editor
. * Changing something to an explosion no longer can cause weird
.  colors
. * Whats New section of help sorted by version
. * Placing a robot over the player is prevented with a warning
. * The "Alt+N- Music" lights up properly in the editor now
. * When chaning from a larger board to a smaller board, you can
.  no longer accidentally have the cursor outside of the board
.  size
. * GUS owners don't need to enter # of SFX channels, since
.  MegaZeux cannot support GUS sound effects anyways.
. * Fileboxes (loading MODs, worlds, etc.) can now hold as many
.  filenames as memory allows.
. * GUS setup shown properly on configuration screen
. * 2GDM.EXE rewritten- In THIS release, it can only convert
.  MOD, NST, WOW, OCT, 669, and S3M files! The final (2.50)
.  release will have support for the remaining file formats.
.  It is being rewritten to fix many small bugs and make it
.  smaller and faster, as well as possibly add more file
.  formats.
. * 2GDM.EXE- F00 effect in MODs deleted during conversion
. * 2GDM.EXE- Bad effects S8x, S0x, and Xxx deleted during S3M
.  conversion
. * 2GDM.EXE now works properly from other directories
. * INTERNAL MOD loading support. You can now load MODs, NSTs,
.  WOWs, and OCTs from within the game without having to
.  convert them to GDM first. The only exception is 15-
.  instrument MODs- they must first be converted. Note that
.  all other formats, such as S3M, 669, etc. must still be
.  converted. NST/WOW/OCT support was only added because they
.  are extremely similar to MODs, and MODs were required for
.  backward compatibility.
. * Insert doesn't display those "Lo bomb selected" messages,
.  etc. if the player is Attack Locked or settings say he
.  cannot bomb.
. * Minor bugs in ANSi import corrected. (problem fixed- caused
.  errors on import of ANSis with more or the same number of
.  lines as the current board size maximum)
. * "Ammo <10" and "Ammo >9" entries in Global Chars changed to
.  "Small Ammo" and "Large Ammo" to prevent confusion.

~ENew in version 2.48b-

. * ALL NEW music code! Features include faster, NO BUGs, 32
.  channels, more formats supported (sorry, no MID or XM) etc.
. * Bug where selecting "(no board)" to add a board caused an
.  error if that wasn't the first "(no board)" on the list.
. * Bug where if a robot line entered consisted of only
.  semicolons, spaces, and commas, it would screw up that
.  robot's program, fixed.
. * Command line options (-port,-dma,-irq) added for setting
.  sound card parameters. Only needed if auto-detection fails.
. * Minor help corrections.
. * Save/load during testing in editor disabled.
. * Pressing \ no longer causes problems during gameplay.
. * Bug where "Restart board" for death option in global
.  options didn't function properly on first board, nor did
.  restart-if-zapped. (fixed)
. * Filling in the overlay no longer locks up if you fill over
.  something of the same color and picture.
. * Overlay no longer messed up when resizing board.

. * Setting the counter "INVINCO" to 0 works properly.
. * Hopefully fixed rare lockups after robot box messages.
. * Added confirmation for board deletion in editor.
. * All included worlds are NO LONGER password protected. (The
.  old password was "megahertz".)
. * Minor bugs in passage search algorithms corrected.
. * Obscure bug involving REL prefixes if used in "infinite-
.  loop" type constructs (fixed)
. * In editor- Alt+Dir to move 10 spaces now works as expected
.  with draw mode on. (IE it will draw in ALL 10 spaces)
. * Bug where passages on screens wider than 256 spaces didn't
.  work properly. (fixed)
. * Bug where fire-to-player's-right would lock up and kill him
.  FIXED.
. * Counters can be used in ALL strings in &COUNTER& notation.
.  For example, SEND "ROBOT" "LABEL&COUNTER&" will replace
.  &COUNTER& with a number. This works for ALL strings-
.  counternames, labels, robots, etc. See Robotic help for
.  details.

~ENew in version 2.07-

. * Labels and NON-valid counter-regulated options in robot box
.  messages are not blank lines; Instead they are just removed
.  from the message.
. * Passage (stairs/caves/whirlpools) search algorithm
.  corrected.
. * Digitized sample SFX works properly with the note B now.
. * Bug where getting multiple energizers in a row screwed up
.  player's color is fixed.
. * Bug where chests with invinco potions will die when taken
.  is fixed.
. * Filling in editor, with a robot/scroll/sensor over itself,
.  is now handled properly.

~ENew in version 2.06-

. * Yet more cursor safegaurds inserted. (Where do you GET
.  these problems!? :)
. * Saving a game no longer asks for overwrite confirmation if
.  the file doesn't really exist.
. * Help and tutorial- Minor textual errors fixed
. * Save dialog boxes only allow entry of 12 characters now,
.  instead of 13.
. * Help file can be accessed from any directory.
. * -l cmd line option will no longer cause a loading error with
.  an oversized filename. (it will instead be ignored)

~ENew in version 2.05-

. * Cursor bug fixed. (If it isn't, then get a new BIOS! :p)
. * MegaZeux now utilizes overlaid code, for almost 50k core
.  memory savings.
. * LOCKSCROLL cmd fixed
. * Moving into the lower-right corner of full-size boards no
.  longer warps you to the upper-left corner.
. * SET COLOR and COLOR INTENSITY don't blow up if the color is
.  not from 0 to 16.
. * Code for activating 16 background colors is now shorter and
.  uses BIOS calls for compatibility.

~ENew in version 2.04-

. * Slight modifications to Robotic Tutorial (help file)
. * Sending a robot a message, when it hadn't done anything yet
.  that turn, activates it immediately. This helps with
.  syncronized activities, such as large, multi-robot
.  creatures.
. * ALT+Numerics feature of BIOS keyboard routine DISABLED (IE
.  ALT+3 will no longer break to DOS)
. * Counters' code optimized.
. * The temp file ~EDITRSZ.TMP created when resizing a board is
.  now deleted when finished.
. * a KEYBOARD CODE kink was worked out (hopefully got 'em
.  all...)
. * Made printer code more general (should work on any printer
.  in text mode)
. * PALETTE BUG on some SVGA cards FIXED. (black now looks like
.  black) If it still isn't, please notify me.

.  message/help/scroll.
. * PgUp/PgDn/Mouse navigation work properly in box
.  messages/help/scrolls
. * HOME and END in dialogs works properly now- Unless you are
.  editing a number, they will jump to the FIRST item and the
.  NEXT or OK button, respectively. In a string, they will
.  still jump to the start/end unless you are already there,
.  then they will jump to the proper dialog location.
. * Robots (especially when there are lots of them) sped up.
. * DUPLICATE SELF and COPY ROBOT cmds sped up some, except when
.  used by global robot.
. * Palette intensities reset when going into editor after the
.  title screen changes them.
. * MODULO "str" # will no longer crash if # is 0.
. * Extreme palette activity no longer causes snow or (on EGA)

. * Bug fixed- If a SAM/MOD command had to free up board memory
.  (showing the little "freeing up board memory..." meter) then
.  that robot stopped running.
. * Bug fixed- If the robot changed it's surroundings (IE
.  Putting a SPACE to it's NORTH) and then did a RANDNB or
.  RANDB, the new surroundings weren't always taken into
.  consideration.
. * DIVIDE ERROR crash/bug fixed. (It was related to usage of
.  RANDNB and RANDB)
. * CHAR "A" vs. CHAR 'A' question added to F.A.Q.
. * README.TXT changed- Boot disk/support info added.
. * Help on cmd ."@string" corrected.
. * SPEED defaults to 4 (settings) and is saved in MEGAZEUX.CFG.

~ENew in version 2.03-

.  test game.
. * Messed-up black color on certain graphics cards- Attempted
.  to fix.

.  ANY computer, unless the computer itself is so slow that it
.  forces a slower speed.)
. * CAVERNS has game over screen fixed
. * MOVE PLAYER [dir] "label" command now works properly.
.  (Before, the label was almost always ignored)

~ENew in version 2.02-

.  directories containing version 2.01 or 2.00 .MZX/.MZB files.
. * Nothing can give you negative coins, gems, etc. (such as
.  thieves)
. * Minor robot speed improvements
. * Turning Music Off (Settings in Game) really keeps it
.  off... :)

~ENew in version 2.01-

. * Sensor command CHAR'X' fixed

#NEWIN200.HLP
:1st:~ENew in version 2.00-

. * All code has been rewritten or at least stepped through line
.  by line, except for the music code.
. * New user interface style and startup screen. Lots of neat
.  little items like shadows, nicer colors, etc. Mostly
.  aesthetic but nice. Mouse support also improved.
. * Keyboard code rewritten (again) All alt-lock, shift-lock,
.  and ctrl-lock problems, as well as most other keyboard
.  problems, should not be a problem anymore. You may have to
.  use the -keyb2 command line option. If a key locks, tap it
.  a couple times.
. * No flicker- The game engine now page flips.
