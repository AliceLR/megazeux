# Configuration file for MegaZeux
# August 6, 2004

# Comments begin with #. Whitespace is ignored. Empty lines are
# ignored as well.
# Options are set in the following format:
# option = value
# If value is not given, then it is assumed to be 1.
# You can include spaces in values by escaping them with \s.
# (see the default macros for examples)
# Note that even if the option is given to change the values
# in MZX, this text file will NOT be modified, and hence the
# values will revert to what they are here when you restart MZX.

# Default options are given (and commented out) with
# an explanation. If an option is not chosen at all
# this default will automatically be used.


### Video options ###

# Resolution MZX uses for fullscreen. Note that MZX will always
# be 640x350 centered within the resolution you choose
# (in other words, it won't be stretched). Give in x, y format.
# Use this if the default is giving you problems. Suggested
# values are 640, 400 and 640, 480.
# This resolution may not actually work; if it doesn't, you will
# get the nearest that does.
# You may also try a resolution like 640x700 that multiplies
# the width, then set the multiplier..

#force_resolution = 640, 350

# Make it so the display is stretched by this amount (must be
# integer). This is useful for getting resolutions like 640x700
# to look correct (set to 2).

#force_height_multiplier = 1

# Whether MZX should start up in fullscreen or not.

#fullscreen = 0


### Audio options ###

# Audio buffer size. Setting this to lower can improve latency,
# so audio will be heard sooner after it is set to be changed.
# It is also possible to change PC speaker effects more rapidly
# with lower values. Lower buffer sizes need more CPU power to
# process. The default is adequete for PC speaker playback every
# command at speed 4.

#audio_buffer = 2048

# Allow music to be sampled at higher precision. Increases CPU
# usage but increases audio quality as well.

#enable_oversampling = 0

# Set resampling mode. Choices are:
# none (fastest, poor quality)
# linear (fast, good quality)
# cubic (slow, great quality)
# fir (very slow, excellent quality)

#resampling_mode = linear

# Whether music/samples should be played or not.
# Does not include PC speaker effects.

#music_on = 1

# Whether PC speaker effects should be played or not.

#pc_speaker_on = 1


### Game options ###

# Name of world file that should be loaded when MZX starts.
#startup_file = caverns.mzx

# Default save file name given when you first try to save.
#save_file = saved.sav

# Speed MZX should start at (1 through 9)
#mzx_speed = 4


### Robot editor options ###

# Enable or disable color coding in the editor.
# If color coding is off, ccode_string is used for the entire
# line.
#color_coding_on = 0

# Color codes for various types.
# For colors, use 255 to show a color box.
#ccode_colors = 255
#ccode_commands = 15
#ccode_conditions = 15
#ccode_current_line = 11
#ccode_directions = 3
#ccode_equalities = 0
#ccode_extras = 7
#ccode_immediates = 10
#ccode_items = 11
#ccode_params = 2
#ccode_strings = 14
#ccode_things = 11

# Whether or not "extra words" should be displayed.
# For instance, if turned on, a line like "wait 1" will
# become "wait for 1."

#disassemble_extras = 0

# The base numbers should be displayed as. Valid options
# are 10 and 16 (decimal and hexidecimal). Hex numbers are
# prefixed with a dollar sign ($).

#disassemble_base = 16

# Changing this will allow invalid comments to automatically
# be marked to "delete" or "comment" instead of "ignore".
# Don't change this unless you know what you're doing.

#default_invalid_status = ignore

# Default macros that can be used in the robot editor with
# F6 through F10.

#macro_one = char\s
#macro_two = color\s
#macro_three = goto\s
#macro_four = send\s
