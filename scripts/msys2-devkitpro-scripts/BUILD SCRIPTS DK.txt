This set of scripts is meant to complement the Windows MSYS2 build scripts.
These scripts should be run only after "1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat"
from the Windows scripts has been run.

These scripts also require the latest version of devkitPro to be installed.
Copy the contents of this folder to the root of your MSYS2 directory tree and
modify DevkitProSettings.bat to point to the path of your devkitPro installation.

Individual script info:

DK1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat -- installs extra required tools with pacman.

DK2_BuildDependencies.bat -- collects dependencies required for MegaZeux from
various repositories and builds them.  All work is done in the same working
directory used by the Windows scripts. Only necessary if your devkitPro install
lacks these dependencies; 

DK3_NDS.bat -- generates an NDS build and moves it to the "zips" folder.
DK4_3DS.bat -- generates a 3DS build and moves it to the "zips" folder.
DK5_Wii.bat -- generates a Wii build and moves it to the "zips" folder.
DK6_PSP.bat -- generates a PSP build and moves it to the "zips" folder.
