These scripts are intended for building and uploading releases
of MegaZeux. Copy everything in this directory to the root
directory of a brand new msys2 installation (highly recommended)

Edit 1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat to put in the URL for the
Git repository containing MZX.
Edit 2_CreateReleases.bat to change anything necessary (usually
just the name and branch of the current stable version of MZX)
Edit 3_UploadReleases.bat to uncomment one of the lines, based
on whether you prefer PHP or scp/ssh uploads and whatever your
server is configured for. You may also need to modify
mingw-uploadrelease-ssh.sh if your don't want to upload to the
directory you land at when SSHing to your server.

Then run 1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat, followed by
2_CreateReleases.bat, followed by 3_UploadReleases.bat.
