These scripts are intended for building and uploading releases
of MegaZeux. Copy everything in this directory to the root
directory of a brand new msys2 installation (highly recommended)

Edit 1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat to put in the URL for the
Git repository containing MZX.
Edit VersionSettings.bat, 2_CreateReleases.bat and
3_PackageReleases.bat to change anything necessary (usually just
the name and branch of the current stable version of MZX)
Edit 4_UploadReleases.bat to uncomment one of the lines, based
on whether you prefer PHP or scp/ssh uploads and whatever your
server is configured for. You may also need to modify
mingw-uploadrelease-ssh.sh if your don't want to upload to the
directory you land at when SSHing to your server.

Then run the 4 numbered batch files in order to perform the entire
process. Each batch file will pause at the end to allow you to check for
any errors.
