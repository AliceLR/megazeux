These scripts are intended for building and uploading releases
of MegaZeux. Copy everything in this directory to the root
directory of a brand new msys2 installation (highly recommended)

Edit 1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat to put in the URL for the
Git repository containing MZX.
Edit VersionSettings.bat, 2_CreateReleases.bat and
3_PackageReleases.bat to change anything necessary (usually just
the name and branch of the current stable version of MZX)
Edit 4_UploadReleases.bat to uncomment one of the lines, based
on whether you prefer PHP or scp/ssh uploads and whatever your
server is configured for. You may also need to modify
mingw-uploadrelease-ssh.sh if your don't want to upload to the
directory you land at when SSHing to your server.

Run the 4 numbered batch files in order to perform the entire
process. Each batch file will pause at the end to allow you to
check for any errors.

Note that, the first time you run 1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat
it will ask you to close the terminal without returning to the
shell. Close the terminal, ignoring any warnings that there are
processes still running, then rerun 1_PrepareReleaseEnvironment.bat
