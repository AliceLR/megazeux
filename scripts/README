These scripts probably only work for me, but you might find them useful
to adapt. They basically allow me to use a variety of cross compilers to build
MZX for multiple non-Linux platforms, on Linux. This greatly speeds up the
building of new release binaries.

The deps/ folder contains some binaries for darwin, windows, nds and wii which
aren't included in the MegaZeux tree for various licensing reasons. They're
necessary to build binaries for these platforms.
