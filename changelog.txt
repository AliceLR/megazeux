	if the board width is too small
+ Fixed bug where turning off the menu with a board too small would mess

	load

  applied to the palette a game loads with

	byte charset to be exported (8bit wraparound)

  end of the line

  that
+ Fixed bug where MZX would crash if put dir player overwrote the robot
  doing it
+ Fixed bug where playing SAMs would eventually crash MZX
+ Fixed some mod * problems (hopefully?)
+ Fixed bug where pasting blocks over the edge of the board in the editor
  would cause MZX to crash
