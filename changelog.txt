+ Fixed cursor going invisible when escaping from import in the editor
+ Fixed robot editor entry when pressing OK on global info
+ Fixed lack of name for MZB import/export (any MZB's exported in prior
  beta versions still won't have a name)
+ Fixed some problems with setting the mouse position
+ Fixed problem with exits not bringing you all the way to the edge if width
  over 400 or height over 200
+ Fixed bug that cleared too much when increasing both width and height while
  resizing the board
+ Fixed problem with 1 char shortcut commands with spaces immediately after them
+ Fixed problems with load_robot and load_bc (caused crashes and infinite loops)
+ Optmized RASM heavily (this should be most noticable when doing a lot of
  external robot loading from text files)
+ Fixed inability to use absolute paths in loading a game from command line
+ Fixed lastshot/lasttouch conditions with directions not working
+ Fixed char editor in robots not going into SMZX mode when proper
+ Cleaned up source code so it passes -Wall without complaint and in the process
  corrected some glaring code errors that may have corrected random problems
+ File opening broken in 2.80c, fixed
+ Implemented MZM2 saving and loading and rewrote mzm.cpp (if anything is changed
  or fixed regarding MZMs, attribute it to this). MZM2s can be of larger
  dimensions, smaller filesize for same amount of data, and can store robots.
+ Fixed bug that could cause MZX to crash when making new strings
+ Block operations to overlay when overlay was off caused crashes - fixed
+ Fixed a problem with sprite ccheck2 against other sprites
+ Optimized function counter lookups a bit; speed gain for all counter accesses
  (especially ones that begin with certain characters such as _)
+ Fixed disassembly error with ' ' character
+ Fixed assembly error where condition extended dir (such as blocked opp seek)
  was not getting compiled with the dir extension
+ Fixed editor bug where the param was not being cleared when overwriting things
  by double placement
+ Fixed inability to use counters with playercolor/bulletcolor/missilecolor
+ Added ability to use counters in place of p?? in the robot editor
  Note - even though this expands functionality of the editor this does not
  require a version number change because the worlds will still be playable in
  older MZX versions (and will display correctly in the robot editor - you simply
  won't be able to correctly edit the commands)
+ Mouse correctly limited to screen edges now
+ Fixed inability to overwrite robots with pushable robots and vice-versa,
  as well as scrolls with signs and vice-versa
+ Possibly fixed problem with windowing error when editing global robot (?)
+ Fixed disappearing cursor after color selection box with mouse (and other places?)
+ Fixed bug in sprite clipping that caused some to be clipped off inappropriately
+ Made board_id/board_param counters readable
+ Added bound checks for all counters using board_x/board_y/overlay_x/overlay_y
+ Removed ability to put robots, scrolls/signs, and sensors (with the put command in
  Robotic)
+ Fixed potential direction corruption bug causing directions not to work
  sometimes even if they display correctly in the robot editor
+ Fixed copy overlay to MZM copying to overlay too
+ Fixed a bug where debug window could display the wrong amount of robot mem
  and potentially even crash MZX
+ Fixed help_menu counter not doing anything (durr)
+ Changed sprite draw order so they're drawn underneath the message bar,
  debug box, and time remaining display
+ Changed put p?? in Robotic so it will put default params if available
+ Fixed a bug that could cause copies from overlay to vlayer to not end up at
  the correct destination
+ Fixed a bug where c?x and cx? would not display correctly in the robot editor
+ Optimized copy blocks a bit using variable length arrays instead of malloc
