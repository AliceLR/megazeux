Description: A simple game creation system (GCS)
 MegaZeux is a Game Creation System (GCS), inspired by Epic MegaGames' ZZT,
 first released by Alexis Janson in 1994. It was recently ported from 16bit
 MSDOS C/ASM to portable SDL C/C++, improving its platform support and
 hardware compatibility.
 .
 Many features have been added since the original DOS version, and with the
 help of an intuitive editor and a simple but powerful object-oriented
 programming language, MegaZeux allows you to create your own ANSI-esque games
 regardless of genre. It is actively maintained by a thriving community.
