Description: A simple game creation system (GCS).
 MegaZeux is a Game Creation System (GCS), inspired by Epic MegaGames' ZZT.
 It was recently ported from 16bit MSDOS C/ASM to portable SDL C++, which has
 vastly improved its platform support and hardware compatibility.
 Many features have been added compared to the original DOS version.
 With the help of an intuitive editor and a simple but powerful object-oriented
 programming language, MegaZeux allows you to create your own ANSI-esque games
 regardless of genre. It is actively maintained by a thriving community.
