BUILDING MEGAZEUX FOR DEBIAN

MegaZeux was tested as building on Debian Unstable as of May, 2007. You must
first rename the source directory "megazeux-2.83b", for example, to match the
required Debian standard. MegaZeux is usually shipped as "mzx283b", for
historical reasons.

You can then generate a deb file for your architecture by typing:

debuild -us -uc

Which will create a deb, changes, source, and dsc file in the directory above
this one. These may be added to an 'apt' repository, if you desire.

--ajs.
