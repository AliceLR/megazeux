***NEW in 2.62*** - Exophase

~FStrings

MZX 2.62 has 10 strings. They are referenced as such:

~B$string0
~B$string1
...
~B$string9

Note that they use up actual counter namespace, so if you use
over 1000 counters you'll probably overwrite the strings.

~FSetting strings

You can set a string to eight things, in the format of
~Bset $stringN to PARAMETER
where N is the number of the string and PARAMETER is one of
the following:

~BINPUT
The value taken from the "input string" command.

~BBOARD_NAME
The name of the current board.

~BBOARD_SCAN
A string scanned in from the board directly.
Its coordinates are Board_x, Board_y and the string is
terminated by an asterisk (*)

For example, with a board that has "my string*" at 10, 10:
~Bset "Board_x" 10
~Bset "Board_y" 10
~Bset "$string0" "BOARD_SCAN"
Will scan "my string" into $string0.

~BFWRITE
This does not actually set the string to anything, but will
write the string to the currently open write file.

~BFREAD
Will read the string in from the currently open read file.

~B"string"
Will set the string to a literal string, for example:
~Bset "$string0" "hello!"

~B"$string"
Will set the string to another string.

~B(number)
Will set the string to an integer value.

~FOutputting strings

You can output strings in anywhere where MZX supports strings,
within ampersands. For instance:

~Bset "$string0" "Test"
~Bwrite overlay c0f 0 0 "&$string0&"

Will write "Test" at 0, 0 in the overlay.

As mentioned above, you can "set" a string to FWRITE to output it
to the current write file.

~FComparing strings
You can use the "if" command with a string, with either another
string, a string literal, or a number. Note that the string must
be the first paramter, and that you can not use input, board_scan,
etc (load them into another string then compare). Also note that
you can only use equality (=) or inequality. Any other comparisons
will always be FALSE (if you don't like this, blame Greg's limitted
str_cmp function :p)

Example:
~Binput string "Give me a string."
~Bset "$string0" "Input"
~Bif "$string0" = "Bob" "Okay"
~Bend 

~FOther new features
The "mod_order" counter will report the current order (that is,
patter) the playing module is at. Used in conjunction with
the jump mod order command it can be used to save/restore a mod
position between boards...

~FNotes/Bugs

- MZX 2.62 files are no longer forward compatible. That means that
  a file made in MZX 2.62 will NOT work in any previous versions
  (but it WILL work in future versions, so long as they set the
  version string correctly)

- The string reading from files may not work correctly on the first
  read (that is, it might truncate the first character of the string)
  For this reason I suggest putting a junk string in the first part
  of the file and reading it first.
