and .MZB files. Version 2.00/2.01 .SAV files cannot be fixed and if they
cause problems, should be deleted. The bug involved the screen not showing
the player and/or not scrolling properly with the player. If this ever
happens in version 2.51, just run FIX.EXE again. It only works on the
files in the current directory.
