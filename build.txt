How to build MegaZeux 2.80+:

First, you need the source for MZX, obviously, which can be found on
http://www.digitalmzx.net/ and http://www.zeuxworld.com/
(as of this writing. It should show up on megazeux.sourceforge.net
eventually)

Next, you need the correct libraries installed, which are the
 following:

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/

libmodplug: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/modplug-xmms/

gdm2s3m: http://mzx.bitpack.net/gdm2s3m-1.1.tar.gz
(should also show up on other sites soon)

NOTE: As of this writing, libmodplug (version 0.7) has a bug that
doesn't allow it to correctly load 2-channel FT2 saved mods. There
is a patch included to rectify this; you should patch libmodplug
before building if you have this version.

Now, you need GCC installed and GNU make to actually build. Currently,
GCC on Windows and Linux are supported. Use Makefile.linux to build on
Linux, and the vanilla Makefile to build on Windows. As of this writing,
the only compiler that has been tested on Windows is mingw. I suggest
anyone who's interested in building on Windows uses it:

http://www.mingw.org/
