Title: Robotic Color/Parameter Test (IF THING BENEATH, overlay)
Author: Alice Rowan
Desc: Comprehensive test for color and parameter Robotic arguments, including normal, wildcards, invalid, and counters. These programs contain hex edited commands that may not disassemble. This test only includes char commands (needs BOARD_CHAR), overlay commands (needs OVERLAY_COLOR) and IF THING BENEATH (added in 2.51s2, which looks identical to 2.60).
