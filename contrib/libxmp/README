                              Version 4.6


OVERVIEW

Libxmp is a library that renders module files to PCM data. It supports
over 90 mainstream and obscure module formats including Protracker (MOD),
Scream Tracker 3 (S3M), Fast Tracker II (XM), and Impulse Tracker (IT).

Many compressed module formats are supported, including popular Unix, DOS,
and Amiga file packers including gzip, bzip2, SQSH, Powerpack, etc.


LIBRARY API

See docs/libxmp.html for the library API reference. The documentation
is also available in man page and PDF formats.


SUPPORTED FORMATS

See docs/formats.txt for the list of supported formats. By default,
Protracker modules are played with a reasonable mix of Protracker 2/3
quirks (because certain Protracker 1/2 bugs are just too weird and
generally not worth emulating). Other Amiga 4 channel MODs are played with
a generic Noisetracker/Protracker-style replayer, Scream Tracker III MODs
are played with a Scream Tracker style replayer and multichannel MOD
variations are played with a Fasttracker II style replayer. Multifile
formats (Startrekker AM, Magnetic Fields, etc). must have all files in
the same directory.


SUPPORTED PACKERS

The following formats have built-in decompressors: bz2, gz, lha, oxm, xz,
Z, zip, ArcFS, arc, MMCMP, PowerPack, !Spark, SQSH, MUSE, LZX, and S404.
Other compressed formats need helpers to be installed on the system:
mo3 (unmo3) and rar (unrar).
