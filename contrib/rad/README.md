## Reality Adlib Tracker Player

This is a modified version of the RAD 2.x player for MegaZeux. Included:

* RAD 1.x playback and validation support.
* New functions required for MegaZeux's set_order/set_position and get_length.
* A bugfix for Dxx.
* Some -pedantic warning fixes.

As the RAD player code is public domain, so are these modifications. If you find this
useful, go ahead and use it.

Please visit the Reality website for the latest version of the RAD tracker, the
original version of this playback code, and .RAD music releases by Reality:
