1.7

Un-inline some functions to enable the build on MacOS X. We weren't buying much
anyway.

1.6

Fix an explicit cast allowing this to be built with G++.

1.5

Hopefully allows compile under windows cygwin.

1.4

Fixed some overzealous casting in pointer arithmetic. Now 64bit-pointer clean.
Tested on my Athlon 64.

1.3

Ported to MSVC, wrote build.txt makefile. I won't be able to maintain this,
but it'll be a start for any MSVC developer interested.

1.2

Make endian safe (port to Mac OS X). Tested. Thanks Inuchance.

1.1

Fixes note cut bug (affecting some effects).

1.0

Initial release
