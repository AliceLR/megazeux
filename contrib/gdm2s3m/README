GDM2S3M UTILITY V1.7

This utility is designed to convert GDM, a format developed by the ALSA
developer Edward Schlunder, many years ago, into the ScreamTracker 3 file
format (S3M).

It is likely to contain bugs. See the CREDITS file for contact details
should you isolate a bug.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING

Build the software with "make":

On Linux:
make BUILD=linux

On Windows MINGW:
make

As of version 1.3, compiling with Microsoft's free Visual C++ 2003 toolkit
compiler is supported. You can obtain this from:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

At the time of writing, this compiler was free. A crappy batch file is
provided for building both a static library, and the standalone EXE.

Under the toolkit shell, type:
build.bat

USAGE

cd src
./gdm2s3m <file.gdm> <file.s3m>
