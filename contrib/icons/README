MODULAR ICON SET SUPPORT

This directory is where icon themes are placed ready for distribution on
various platforms. The layout is modelled after FreeDesktop.org's "icon naming
specification", allowing the icons to be used immediately on UNIX platforms.


ADDING ICON(S) / PACKS

Under contrib/icons, create a new $PACK sub-directory. Inside this directory,
create icons with the names:

	megazeux-apps.png
	mzx-mimetypes.svg
	chr-mimetypes.png
	.. etc ..

The icons can be any dimension as long as they are in 32bit color and named
appropriately. These files will be converted to FDO icon packs or ICO files
as appropriate.


GENERATING FDO ICONSETS

Running the script "makeset.sh" under MSYS or Linux will generate a
$PACK.tar.gz file which contains versions of the set at multiple resolutions.

./makeset.sh quantump

It will also rename the files and nest them in subdirectories.

See http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-0.8.html
for more information about the FDO icon naming specification.


GENERATING ICO FILES

Currently, there is no program available to do this. This is partially due to
the only open source program available (png2ico) not supporting the alpha
channel.

For the moment, the excellent http://converticon.com/ site is being used
manually to generate icon packs.


MAKING MEGAZEUX USE THE ICONS ON THE WINDOWS PLATFORM

Edit src/Makefile and search for "ICON". The filename here needs to changed
from "contrib/icons/quantump.${o}" to an appropriate name for your pack. Then
issue:

make ICON=1

Which will combine the icon with the binary (under mingw32/win32 platforms).

--ajs
