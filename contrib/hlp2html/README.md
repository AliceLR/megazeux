# hlp2html resources

These are the extra resources required by hlp2html. They should not be
distributed with MegaZeux builds as they will instead be embedded into the
generated HTML help files.

Most of these files are derivatives of files originally created for the
DigitalMZX Online Help Viewer in 2012.

## Credits:

* Lachesis: this README, the css files, and hlp2html.
* Dr. Lancer-X: MegaZeux fonts.
