This directory contains a subset of the minizip wrapper around zlib from
the mainline zlib package (version 1.2.3). Only the unzip code (without
decrypt support) has been taken. Minor compile warnings were fixed, but
there have otherwise been no modifications.

The minizip wrapper is provided under the same license as the zlib-1.2.3
sources, the zlib license. This license is compatible with the GNU GPL.
